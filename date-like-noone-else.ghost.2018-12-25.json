You don’t understand the simple fact that all Buddhas are the same – they are simply statues of the same person. You have become attached to your Buddha, even though the entire teaching of Buddha is non-attachment.”Monk carried on: “This serves you right. The buddha has shown you that attachment makes you dirty. So beware! Go to a goldsmith so he can clean and polish your Buddha. But from now on, just think of THE Buddha.

In the West, women are valued no more than bread in the grocery store. Their contribution is discounted, undervalued and not recognized.

Here, women usually cannot benefit from close communication with other family members. They made so many movies with a title “How to survive family reunion this Christmas”. Naturally, western women feel lonely, especially if they are not part of the religious community. Because of the feelings of loneliness, they want to get out into the world to enjoy life a little in a bar or work place. This is an illusion of joy created by the liberation movement.

The daughter not only relies on the love and support of her mother. In this small world she absorbs “truths” about this world from her.

If a man is thoughts and ideas, a woman is their embodiment. If a pure and faithful wife believes in her man. But if she is jaded, unhappy and unsatisfied with him – his is simply doomed to succeed. Creator kills his own creation instead of making it a masterpiece. A woman with a healthy woman’s energy has the gift to put into his head any ideas and visions that he will later turn into live. That’s why, the thought of a woman is equated with the action of a man. But only, of course, if she is devoted to her man, sincerely believes in him, knows how to serve selflessly. Women’s energy is able to save or kill. It is good for a husband to be under protection of an energetically strong woman. And even at a distance, this defense is very powerful. #becomehappy #findingpurpose #findingpeace #findinghappiness #findingyourself #selflovefirst❤ #selfloveisthebestlove😘 #selflovejourney🌷 #harmonyisthesourceofbeauty #beyourownbeloved #youaretheone #yourlifeisyourart #youaretheprincess #youaretheuniverse #youarethereason #yourwayofthinking #yourchoiceyourlife #yourwayoflife #yourvalue #innerlight #blessallpeople #femalepower #divineenergy #pureabsolutebeauty #acceptyourgreatness #divinelight #divinepurpose #divinepowers #datingyourself</a></p> <p style=\\\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\\\">A post shared by <a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/chiefdatingofficer/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\\\" style=\\\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> Date like noone else</a> (@chiefdatingofficer) on <time style=\\\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\\\" datetime=\\\"2018-10-08T16:01:02+00:00\\\">Oct 8, 2018 at 9:01am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\\\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\\\"></script>\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"FINALLY!!!

I am coming from a different species which were stuck in that matrix (aka simulation - That is another story - I will tell you all about it if you'd like me to). I like to explain things colorfully, not just accept them because they are coming from the Bible.

And don't you worry - I have KGB memory - I don't need any database. So FIRST MONTH of me of asking you difficult questions will be FREE.\\n\\n\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"\\n# Rules:\\n1. Yes. It is that long of a program. Some girl asked - could I just skip dating and go straight to serious relationships? No. It is part and the rule. You don't like it - you are not a good fit for the program! \\n2. No sex, hookups in closets, living together, test drive or free wife trial before the marriage!\\n3. Noone can take your breath away within 3 months even 6 months! A man starts from \\\"a boring nerd\\\" and can grow to become Good Enough after a month of dating. You are a picky Woman.   \\n4. Dating at least 3 lucky guys at a time. I will have lectures on where you can meet a nobel man and why it is important to date 3 at a time. \\n5. You will have to do your reading of articles and some other material I will be sending you. And I will also ask you to do some tasks that you will need to perforn and tell me next time I see you how it went.\\n\\n# Phases:\\n1. We will be working on our worth, self esteem which society lowered since we went to a kindergarden. We learned to live in the man's world and play by their rules - we become equal. Then why is this girl is crying her eyes out because he dumped her, and the guy is bragging about dumping her? We should all explore our sexuality - but why does it hurt so bad... \\n2. We will have each other in order to lift each other up. With the power of technology will have technology you can reach me any time and quigly ask super important question of emergency. If you feel like \\\"I saw him and it was the love from the firts side\\\" - this is definetly an emergency. Not be fooled - call me. It is safer. \\n3. Please write some memorable events that happenned between our sessions. It can be inspiration or an abscure guy... So we can clear him. Like a scanner. \\n4. Dating, emotional harmony, relationships of souls, engagement and the wedding.THAT IS THE PLAN.\\n5. I will be giving you non traditional exercises that should become your daily routine. No. Those are not to repeating the generic quotes in front of the mirror for 2 hors. Everything I produce original and from the heart and again - I will act as magic. \\n\\n# Format of our work:  \\nGood news: I want to be honest and make it like a journey, where people from all over the world coming together and trying to solve the same problem. And they become friends. \\n\\nBad news: Unfortunately world runs on money. It is a long program and your commitment and dedication. It is a lot of work for me and even bigger commitment for me, because i have to do my homework, read, wright and amuse you. \\n\\n- First month is free which consists of first intake face to face where I learn about your background and we get to know each other. \\n- And after the first seccion you will get homework (yes - already). \\n- We will meet twice a month. 1,5-2 hours of practical advice, those rules of life that I learned from scriptures and from being an evolutionary biologist. Life hack course. \\n\\n\\n# Why Am I doing that?\\n\\nDon't think that the small fee for a membership that will change your life is a loss, it is an investment into your carefree protected life with beloved husband. I think, career coaches for women, people who tell you that you are enough and you can build an empire is not the right pathway for a woman to choose. Moreover it sends you to the path of great unhappiness. (sorry career coaches - but you only make men happy). I offer you to fulfill all desires of your heart - motherhood, empire, a husband who would take care of your, your kids and your elderly parents and you have to have only one qualification - to be a woman. And willingness to become the biggest inspiration for your husband. \\n\\nI started this not because I love money more than people. But the money always comes up. I value relationship more than money. ANd I would like to see you as divine creatures, not how many dollars I can make from each of you by selling high ticket programs. I want thriving community of women finally reclaiming their place in the world. And if everyone will be on its place and do what ever brings joy - that is called happiness. \\n\\n# How much: \\n## 60$ per month. First month FREE. Monthly price includes 2 meetings 2 hours each where I will have a topic each time and fill you with useful information like.\\n- Differences between men and women on biological level and spiritual. Illusions of women regarding love. How to make your man the man of honor by being the inspiration for him. Warning signs this man is destroying you. 14 Questions you need ask before the wedding day. Stages of building relationships. 6 Steps To Increase Female Self Esteem. 30 habits you need to leave behind moving forward to a happy marriage. 10 myths about sex. How to protect your man from being irresponsible. 10 Qualities of a good Man. 9 women's silly mistakes that can become lethal for the family.  \\n\\n# Here is my promise: \\n- if you don't like me or what I talk about or any of those rules. You can drop out after first month no problem.\\n- if you would like to freeze your membership - and go to spiritual retreat, practice belly dance, get 2 massages per day to increase your feminine energy, or take a long walk to himallaii. \\n- if you want to stop at any point and never hear from me again. I call it a split. You get no more charges. Life goes on.\\n- and if by the end of the year there is no improvement in your self esteem, quality and quantity of your male friends, if noone proposed to you by the end of the year. Or you haven't gone to the stage of relationship of the souls. That means I did not deliver on the promise - I would be happy to give you all money back. \\n- I am not who would dreams to sell high ticket coaching programs. I seriously feel the pain of women who haven't been educated on who they are. And that will make the world as a better place. And not hight ticket coaching.  \\n- Just let's make the most out of it. Be kind to each other. And enjoy the ride. I am going to entertain you. It will be fun.  \"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[10,1],[10,2],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","created_at_ts":1542956490796,"created_at":"2018-11-23T07:01:30.000Z"},{"id":"5bf7af69f8e5703fc27962ed","post_id":"5bed8e28e3fb8c55c259daef","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"http://www.brahmakumaris.org/documents/11179/0/WEP+9+-+CRX2.JPG/d5e96202-74b5-4927-90da-6268bf0c5d4f?t=1451839397741\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"h3\",[[0,[],0,\"Four Faces of Woman\"]]],[1,\"p\",[]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Have you ever asked the questions, \\\"Who am I really?\\\" and \\\"What does it all mean?\\\"\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The Four Faces of Woman is a model designed to uncover the riches of our past and reveal practical, ancient, spiritual keys to build a future that holds a deeper and meaningful happiness.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"You will find tools and simple, yet profound, insights that enable you to be your truest, most loving and powerful self.\"]]],[10,0],[1,\"h4\",[[0,[],0,\"Eternal Face\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Where we begin and where we're heading.

If a man is thoughts and ideas, a woman is their embodiment. If a pure and faithful wife believes in her man. But if she is jaded, unhappy and unsatisfied with him – his is simply doomed to succeed. Creator kills his own creation instead of making it a masterpiece. A woman with a healthy woman’s energy has the gift to put into his head any ideas and visions that he will later turn into live. That’s why, the thought of a woman is equated with the action of a man. But only, of course, if she is devoted to her man, sincerely believes in him, knows how to serve selflessly. Women’s energy is able to save or kill. It is good for a husband to be under protection of an energetically strong woman. And even at a distance, this defense is very powerful. #becomehappy #findingpurpose #findingpeace #findinghappiness #findingyourself #selflovefirst❤ #selfloveisthebestlove😘 #selflovejourney🌷 #harmonyisthesourceofbeauty #beyourownbeloved #youaretheone #yourlifeisyourart #youaretheprincess #youaretheuniverse #youarethereason #yourwayofthinking #yourchoiceyourlife #yourwayoflife #yourvalue #innerlight #blessallpeople #femalepower #divineenergy #pureabsolutebeauty #acceptyourgreatness #divinelight #divinepurpose #divinepowers #datingyourself</a></p> <p style=\\\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\\\">A post shared by <a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/chiefdatingofficer/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\\\" style=\\\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> Date like noone else</a> (@chiefdatingofficer) on <time style=\\\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\\\" datetime=\\\"2018-10-08T16:01:02+00:00\\\">Oct 8, 2018 at 9:01am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\\\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\\\"></script>\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"FINALLY!!!

Noone can take your breath away within 3 months even 6 months! A man starts from \\\"a boring nerd\\\" and can grow to become Good Enough after a month of dating. You are a picky Woman.   \\n4. Dating at least 3 lucky guys at a time. I will have lectures on where you can meet a nobel man and why it is important to date 3 at a time. \\n5. You will have to do your reading of articles and some other material I will be sending you. And I will also ask you to do some tasks that you will need to perforn and tell me next time I see you how it went.\\n\\n# Phases:\\n1. We will be working on our worth, self esteem which society lowered since we went to a kindergarden. We learned to live in the man's world and play by their rules - we become equal.

No. Those are not to repeating the generic quotes in front of the mirror for 2 hors.

And they become friends. \\n\\nBad news: Unfortunately world runs on money. It is a long program and your commitment and dedication. It is a lot of work for me and even bigger commitment for me, because i have to do my homework, read, wright and amuse you. \\n\\n- First month is free which consists of first intake face to face where I learn about your background and we get to know each other. \\n- And after the first seccion you will get homework (yes - already). \\n- We will meet twice a month. 1,5-2 hours of practical advice, those rules of life that I learned from scriptures and from being an evolutionary biologist. Life hack course. \\n\\n\\n# Why Am I doing that?\\n\\nDon't think that the small fee for a membership that will change your life is a loss, it is an investment into your carefree protected life with beloved husband. I think, career coaches for women, people who tell you that you are enough and you can build an empire is not the right pathway for a woman to choose. Moreover it sends you to the path of great unhappiness. (sorry career coaches - but you only make men happy). I offer you to fulfill all desires of your heart - motherhood, empire, a husband who would take care of your, your kids and your elderly parents and you have to have only one qualification - to be a woman. And willingness to become the biggest inspiration for your husband. \\n\\nI started this not because I love money more than people. But the money always comes up. I value relationship more than money. ANd I would like to see you as divine creatures, not how many dollars I can make from each of you by selling high ticket programs. I want thriving community of women finally reclaiming their place in the world. And if everyone will be on its place and do what ever brings joy - that is called happiness. \\n\\n# How much: \\n## 60$ per month. First month FREE. Monthly price includes 2 meetings 2 hours each where I will have a topic each time and fill you with useful information like.\\n- Differences between men and women on biological level and spiritual. Illusions of women regarding love. How to make your man the man of honor by being the inspiration for him. Warning signs this man is destroying you. 14 Questions you need ask before the wedding day. Stages of building relationships. 6 Steps To Increase Female Self Esteem. 30 habits you need to leave behind moving forward to a happy marriage. 10 myths about sex. How to protect your man from being irresponsible. 10 Qualities of a good Man. 9 women's silly mistakes that can become lethal for the family.  \\n\\n# Here is my promise: \\n- if you don't like me or what I talk about or any of those rules. You can drop out after first month no problem.\\n- if you would like to freeze your membership - and go to spiritual retreat, practice belly dance, get 2 massages per day to increase your feminine energy, or take a long walk to himallaii. \\n- if you want to stop at any point and never hear from me again. I call it a split. You get no more charges. Life goes on.\\n- and if by the end of the year there is no improvement in your self esteem, quality and quantity of your male friends, if noone proposed to you by the end of the year. Or you haven't gone to the stage of relationship of the souls. That means I did not deliver on the promise - I would be happy to give you all money back. \\n- I am not who would dreams to sell high ticket coaching programs. I seriously feel the pain of women who haven't been educated on who they are. And that will make the world as a better place. And not hight ticket coaching.  \\n- Just let's make the most out of it. Be kind to each other. And enjoy the ride. I am going to entertain you. It will be fun.  \"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"<!-- Calendly inline widget begin -->\\n<div class=\\\"calendly-inline-widget\\\" data-url=\\\"https://calendly.com/irinabulygina/120\\\" style=\\\"min-width:320px;height:580px;\\\"></div>\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\" src=\\\"https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.js\\\"></script>\\n<!-- Calendly inline widget end -->\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[10,1],[10,2],[10,3],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","created_at_ts":1542960776588,"created_at":"2018-11-23T08:12:56.000Z"},{"id":"5bf7b6fcf8e5703fc27962ef","post_id":"5be2924c297406512b26ea77","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"<blockquote class=\\\"instagram-media\\\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BorZXsaArVl/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\\\" data-instgrm-version=\\\"12\\\" style=\\\" background:#FFF;

If a man is thoughts and ideas, a woman is their embodiment. If a pure and faithful wife believes in her man. But if she is jaded, unhappy and unsatisfied with him – his is simply doomed to succeed. Creator kills his own creation instead of making it a masterpiece. A woman with a healthy woman’s energy has the gift to put into his head any ideas and visions that he will later turn into live. That’s why, the thought of a woman is equated with the action of a man. But only, of course, if she is devoted to her man, sincerely believes in him, knows how to serve selflessly. Women’s energy is able to save or kill. It is good for a husband to be under protection of an energetically strong woman. And even at a distance, this defense is very powerful. #becomehappy #findingpurpose #findingpeace #findinghappiness #findingyourself #selflovefirst❤ #selfloveisthebestlove😘 #selflovejourney🌷 #harmonyisthesourceofbeauty #beyourownbeloved #youaretheone #yourlifeisyourart #youaretheprincess #youaretheuniverse #youarethereason #yourwayofthinking #yourchoiceyourlife #yourwayoflife #yourvalue #innerlight #blessallpeople #femalepower #divineenergy #pureabsolutebeauty #acceptyourgreatness #divinelight #divinepurpose #divinepowers #datingyourself</a></p> <p style=\\\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\\\">A post shared by <a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/chiefdatingofficer/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\\\" style=\\\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> Date like noone else</a> (@chiefdatingofficer) on <time style=\\\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\\\" datetime=\\\"2018-10-08T16:01:02+00:00\\\">Oct 8, 2018 at 9:01am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\\\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\\\"></script>\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"FINALLY!!!

If a man is thoughts and ideas, a woman is their embodiment. If a pure and faithful wife believes in her man. But if she is jaded, unhappy and unsatisfied with him – his is simply doomed to succeed. Creator kills his own creation instead of making it a masterpiece. A woman with a healthy woman’s energy has the gift to put into his head any ideas and visions that he will later turn into live. That’s why, the thought of a woman is equated with the action of a man. But only, of course, if she is devoted to her man, sincerely believes in him, knows how to serve selflessly. Women’s energy is able to save or kill. It is good for a husband to be under protection of an energetically strong woman. And even at a distance, this defense is very powerful. #becomehappy #findingpurpose #findingpeace #findinghappiness #findingyourself #selflovefirst❤ #selfloveisthebestlove😘 #selflovejourney🌷 #harmonyisthesourceofbeauty #beyourownbeloved #youaretheone #yourlifeisyourart #youaretheprincess #youaretheuniverse #youarethereason #yourwayofthinking #yourchoiceyourlife #yourwayoflife #yourvalue #innerlight #blessallpeople #femalepower #divineenergy #pureabsolutebeauty #acceptyourgreatness #divinelight #divinepurpose #divinepowers #datingyourself</a></p> <p style=\\\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\\\">A post shared by <a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/chiefdatingofficer/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\\\" style=\\\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> Date like noone else</a> (@chiefdatingofficer) on <time style=\\\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\\\" datetime=\\\"2018-10-08T16:01:02+00:00\\\">Oct 8, 2018 at 9:01am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\\\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\\\"></script>\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"FINALLY!!! IT IS HERE!!! That means I care about you guys a lot!\\n\\nI want to change your life one by one. One life after another. One broken heart after another. I have a cure for your wounds, girls. I have it!! I committed to heal your scars of every woman out there, because I feel your suffering. \\nAnd I am on the mission to change your set of mind - kinda pass my knowledge into you ultimately transforming and rebooting your mentality. (not painful - actually lots of fun and no surgery involved).\\nFull disclosure: I am always a bad cop. And I use shock therapy.\\n\\nThe goal is not give you a fish and feed you with meaningless quotes from some database and give you affirmations and let you go with blessing. I will teach you how to fish. Meaning you will be able to think rationally about who is good Enough and who hasn't gotten there. \\n\\nThe main outcome of this program is my philosophy becomes yours organically. That is the reason why I am not preaching to convert - I expect on the program already converted (meaning you kinda get it and kinda like it). Speaking of which - I am not there to use dogma as an explanation of how the life works. It is the job of religion. I am coming from a different species which were stuck in that matrix (aka simulation - That is another story - I will tell you all about it if you'd like me to). I like to explain things colorfully, not just accept them because they are coming from the Bible. I take a bible or any other scripture and use reasoning and scientific knowledge and explain the legitimacy of the dogmatic claim with my personal magic (working term - you will see what I mean when I do). I connect the dots - I make sense.\\n\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"Here is where the fun starts. I will be an investigator, a nasty one. I will need a background story of each of you. And don't you worry - I have KGB memory - I don't need any database. So FIRST MONTH of me of asking you difficult questions will be FREE.\\n\\n\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"\\n# Rules:\\n1. Yes. It is that long of a program. Some girl asked - could I just skip dating and go straight to serious relationships? No. It is part and the rule. You don't like it - you are not a good fit for the program! \\n2. No sex, hookups in closets, living together, test drive or free wife trial before the marriage!\\n3. Noone can take your breath away within 3 months even 6 months! A man starts from \\\"a boring nerd\\\" and can grow to become Good Enough after a month of dating. You are a picky Woman.   \\n4. Dating at least 3 lucky guys at a time. I will have lectures on where you can meet a nobel man and why it is important to date 3 at a time. \\n5. You will have to do your reading of articles and some other material I will be sending you. And I will also ask you to do some tasks that you will need to perforn and tell me next time I see you how it went.\\n\\n# Phases:\\n1. We will be working on our worth, self esteem which society lowered since we went to a kindergarden. We learned to live in the man's world and play by their rules - we become equal. Then why is this girl is crying her eyes out because he dumped her, and the guy is bragging about dumping her? We should all explore our sexuality - but why does it hurt so bad... \\n2. We will have each other in order to lift each other up. With the power of technology will have technology you can reach me any time and quigly ask super important question of emergency. If you feel like \\\"I saw him and it was the love from the firts side\\\" - this is definetly an emergency. Not be fooled - call me. It is safer. \\n3. Please write some memorable events that happenned between our sessions. It can be inspiration or an abscure guy... So we can clear him. Like a scanner. \\n4. Dating, emotional harmony, relationships of souls, engagement and the wedding.THAT IS THE PLAN.\\n5. I will be giving you non traditional exercises that should become your daily routine. No. Those are not to repeating the generic quotes in front of the mirror for 2 hors. Everything I produce original and from the heart and again - I will act as magic. \\n\\n# Format of our work:  \\nGood news: I want to be honest and make it like a journey, where people from all over the world coming together and trying to solve the same problem. And they become friends. \\n\\nBad news: Unfortunately world runs on money. It is a long program and your commitment and dedication. It is a lot of work for me and even bigger commitment for me, because i have to do my homework, read, wright and amuse you. \\n\\n- First month is free which consists of first intake face to face where I learn about your background and we get to know each other. \\n- And after the first seccion you will get homework (yes - already). \\n- We will meet twice a month. 1,5-2 hours of practical advice, those rules of life that I learned from scriptures and from being an evolutionary biologist. Life hack course. \\n\\n\\n# Why Am I doing that?\\n\\nDon't think that the small fee for a membership that will change your life is a loss, it is an investment into your carefree protected life with beloved husband. I think, career coaches for women, people who tell you that you are enough and you can build an empire is not the right pathway for a woman to choose. Moreover it sends you to the path of great unhappiness. (sorry career coaches - but you only make men happy). I offer you to fulfill all desires of your heart - motherhood, empire, a husband who would take care of your, your kids and your elderly parents and you have to have only one qualification - to be a woman. And willingness to become the biggest inspiration for your husband. \\n\\nI started this not because I love money more than people. But the money always comes up. I value relationship more than money. ANd I would like to see you as divine creatures, not how many dollars I can make from each of you by selling high ticket programs. I want thriving community of women finally reclaiming their place in the world. And if everyone will be on its place and do what ever brings joy - that is called happiness. \\n\\n# How much: \\n## 60$ per month. First month FREE. Monthly price includes 2 meetings 2 hours each where I will have a topic each time and fill you with useful information like.\\n- Differences between men and women on biological level and spiritual. Illusions of women regarding love. How to make your man the man of honor by being the inspiration for him. Warning signs this man is destroying you. 14 Questions you need ask before the wedding day. Stages of building relationships. 6 Steps To Increase Female Self Esteem. 30 habits you need to leave behind moving forward to a happy marriage. 10 myths about sex. How to protect your man from being irresponsible. 10 Qualities of a good Man. 9 women's silly mistakes that can become lethal for the family.  \\n\\n# Here is my promise: \\n- if you don't like me or what I talk about or any of those rules. You can drop out after first month no problem.\\n- if you would like to freeze your membership - and go to spiritual retreat, practice belly dance, get 2 massages per day to increase your feminine energy, or take a long walk to himallaii. \\n- if you want to stop at any point and never hear from me again. I call it a split. You get no more charges. Life goes on.\\n- and if by the end of the year there is no improvement in your self esteem, quality and quantity of your male friends, if noone proposed to you by the end of the year. Or you haven't gone to the stage of relationship of the souls. That means I did not deliver on the promise - I would be happy to give you all money back. \\n- I am not who would dreams to sell high ticket coaching programs.

If a man is thoughts and ideas, a woman is their embodiment. If a pure and faithful wife believes in her man. But if she is jaded, unhappy and unsatisfied with him – his is simply doomed to succeed. Creator kills his own creation instead of making it a masterpiece. A woman with a healthy woman’s energy has the gift to put into his head any ideas and visions that he will later turn into live. That’s why, the thought of a woman is equated with the action of a man. But only, of course, if she is devoted to her man, sincerely believes in him, knows how to serve selflessly. Women’s energy is able to save or kill. It is good for a husband to be under protection of an energetically strong woman. And even at a distance, this defense is very powerful. #becomehappy #findingpurpose #findingpeace #findinghappiness #findingyourself #selflovefirst❤ #selfloveisthebestlove😘 #selflovejourney🌷 #harmonyisthesourceofbeauty #beyourownbeloved #youaretheone #yourlifeisyourart #youaretheprincess #youaretheuniverse #youarethereason #yourwayofthinking #yourchoiceyourlife #yourwayoflife #yourvalue #innerlight #blessallpeople #femalepower #divineenergy #pureabsolutebeauty #acceptyourgreatness #divinelight #divinepurpose #divinepowers #datingyourself</a></p> <p style=\\\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\\\">A post shared by <a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/chiefdatingofficer/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\\\" style=\\\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> Date like noone else</a> (@chiefdatingofficer) on <time style=\\\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\\\" datetime=\\\"2018-10-08T16:01:02+00:00\\\">Oct 8, 2018 at 9:01am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\\\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\\\"></script>\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"FINALLY!!! IT IS HERE!!! That means I care about you guys a lot!\\n\\nI want to change your life one by one. One life after another. One broken heart after another. I have a cure for your wounds, girls. I have it!! I committed to heal your scars of every woman out there, because I feel your suffering. \\nAnd I am on the mission to change your set of mind - kinda pass my knowledge into you ultimately transforming and rebooting your mentality. (not painful - actually lots of fun and no surgery involved).\\nFull disclosure: I am always a bad cop. And I use shock therapy.\\n\\nThe goal is not give you a fish and feed you with meaningless quotes from some database and give you affirmations and let you go with blessing. I will teach you how to fish. Meaning you will be able to think rationally about who is good Enough and who hasn't gotten there. \\n\\nThe main outcome of this program is my philosophy becomes yours organically. That is the reason why I am not preaching to convert - I expect on the program already converted (meaning you kinda get it and kinda like it). Speaking of which - I am not there to use dogma as an explanation of how the life works. It is the job of religion. I am coming from a different species which were stuck in that matrix (aka simulation - That is another story - I will tell you all about it if you'd like me to). I like to explain things colorfully, not just accept them because they are coming from the Bible. I take a bible or any other scripture and use reasoning and scientific knowledge and explain the legitimacy of the dogmatic claim with my personal magic (working term - you will see what I mean when I do). I connect the dots - I make sense.\\n\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"Here is where the fun starts. I will be an investigator, a nasty one. I will need a background story of each of you. And don't you worry - I have KGB memory - I don't need any database. So FIRST MONTH of me of asking you difficult questions will be FREE.\\n\\n\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"\\n# Rules:\\n1. Yes. It is that long of a program. Some girl asked - could I just skip dating and go straight to serious relationships? No. It is part and the rule. You don't like it - you are not a good fit for the program! \\n2. No sex, hookups in closets, living together, test drive or free wife trial before the marriage!\\n3. Noone can take your breath away within 3 months even 6 months! A man starts from \\\"a boring nerd\\\" and can grow to become Good Enough after a month of dating. You are a picky Woman.   \\n4. Dating at least 3 lucky guys at a time. I will have lectures on where you can meet a nobel man and why it is important to date 3 at a time. \\n5. You will have to do your reading of articles and some other material I will be sending you. And I will also ask you to do some tasks that you will need to perforn and tell me next time I see you how it went.\\n\\n# Phases:\\n1. We will be working on our worth, self esteem which society lowered since we went to a kindergarden. We learned to live in the man's world and play by their rules - we become equal. Then why is this girl is crying her eyes out because he dumped her, and the guy is bragging about dumping her? We should all explore our sexuality - but why does it hurt so bad... \\n2. We will have each other in order to lift each other up. With the power of technology will have technology you can reach me any time and quigly ask super important question of emergency. If you feel like \\\"I saw him and it was the love from the firts side\\\" - this is definetly an emergency. Not be fooled - call me. It is safer. \\n3. Please write some memorable events that happenned between our sessions. It can be inspiration or an abscure guy... So we can clear him. Like a scanner. \\n4. Dating, emotional harmony, relationships of souls, engagement and the wedding.THAT IS THE PLAN.\\n5. I will be giving you non traditional exercises that should become your daily routine. No. Those are not to repeating the generic quotes in front of the mirror for 2 hors. Everything I produce original and from the heart and again - I will act as magic. \\n\\n# Format of our work:  \\nGood news: I want to be honest and make it like a journey, where people from all over the world coming together and trying to solve the same problem. And they become friends. \\n\\nBad news: Unfortunately world runs on money. It is a long program and your commitment and dedication. It is a lot of work for me and even bigger commitment for me, because i have to do my homework, read, wright and amuse you. \\n\\n- First month is free which consists of first intake face to face where I learn about your background and we get to know each other. \\n- And after the first seccion you will get homework (yes - already). \\n- We will meet twice a month. 1,5-2 hours of practical advice, those rules of life that I learned from scriptures and from being an evolutionary biologist. Life hack course. \\n\\n\\n# Why Am I doing that?\\n\\nDon't think that the small fee for a membership that will change your life is a loss, it is an investment into your carefree protected life with beloved husband. I think, career coaches for women, people who tell you that you are enough and you can build an empire is not the right pathway for a woman to choose. Moreover it sends you to the path of great unhappiness. (sorry career coaches - but you only make men happy). I offer you to fulfill all desires of your heart - motherhood, empire, a husband who would take care of your, your kids and your elderly parents and you have to have only one qualification - to be a woman. And willingness to become the biggest inspiration for your husband. \\n\\nI started this not because I love money more than people. But the money always comes up. I value relationship more than money. ANd I would like to see you as divine creatures, not how many dollars I can make from each of you by selling high ticket programs. I want thriving community of women finally reclaiming their place in the world. And if everyone will be on its place and do what ever brings joy - that is called happiness. \\n\\n# How much: \\n## 60$ per month. First month FREE. Monthly price includes 2 meetings 2 hours each where I will have a topic each time and fill you with useful information like.\\n- Differences between men and women on biological level and spiritual. Illusions of women regarding love. How to make your man the man of honor by being the inspiration for him. Warning signs this man is destroying you. 14 Questions you need ask before the wedding day. Stages of building relationships. 6 Steps To Increase Female Self Esteem. 30 habits you need to leave behind moving forward to a happy marriage. 10 myths about sex. How to protect your man from being irresponsible. 10 Qualities of a good Man. 9 women's silly mistakes that can become lethal for the family. \\n\\n<!-- Calendly link widget begin -->\\n<link href=\\\"https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.css\\\" rel=\\\"stylesheet\\\">\\n<script src=\\\"https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.js\\\" type=\\\"text/javascript\\\"></script>\\n<a href=\\\"\\\" onclick=\\\"Calendly.showPopupWidget('https://calendly.com/irinabulygina/120');return false;\\\">Schedule time with me</a>\\n<!-- Calendly link widget end -->\\n\\n# Here is my promise: \\n- if you don't like me or what I talk about or any of those rules. You can drop out after first month no problem.\\n- if you would like to freeze your membership - and go to spiritual retreat, practice belly dance, get 2 massages per day to increase your feminine energy, or take a long walk to himallaii. \\n- if you want to stop at any point and never hear from me again. I call it a split. You get no more charges. Life goes on.\\n- and if by the end of the year there is no improvement in your self esteem, quality and quantity of your male friends, if noone proposed to you by the end of the year. Or you haven't gone to the stage of relationship of the souls. That means I did not deliver on the promise - I would be happy to give you all money back. \\n- I am not who would dreams to sell high ticket coaching programs. I seriously feel the pain of women who haven't been educated on who they are. And that will make the world as a better place. And not hight ticket coaching.  \\n- Just let's make the most out of it.

If a man is thoughts and ideas, a woman is their embodiment. If a pure and faithful wife believes in her man. But if she is jaded, unhappy and unsatisfied with him – his is simply doomed to succeed. Creator kills his own creation instead of making it a masterpiece. A woman with a healthy woman’s energy has the gift to put into his head any ideas and visions that he will later turn into live. That’s why, the thought of a woman is equated with the action of a man. But only, of course, if she is devoted to her man, sincerely believes in him, knows how to serve selflessly. Women’s energy is able to save or kill. It is good for a husband to be under protection of an energetically strong woman. And even at a distance, this defense is very powerful. #becomehappy #findingpurpose #findingpeace #findinghappiness #findingyourself #selflovefirst❤ #selfloveisthebestlove😘 #selflovejourney🌷 #harmonyisthesourceofbeauty #beyourownbeloved #youaretheone #yourlifeisyourart #youaretheprincess #youaretheuniverse #youarethereason #yourwayofthinking #yourchoiceyourlife #yourwayoflife #yourvalue #innerlight #blessallpeople #femalepower #divineenergy #pureabsolutebeauty #acceptyourgreatness #divinelight #divinepurpose #divinepowers #datingyourself</a></p> <p style=\\\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\\\">A post shared by <a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/chiefdatingofficer/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\\\" style=\\\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> Date like noone else</a> (@chiefdatingofficer) on <time style=\\\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\\\" datetime=\\\"2018-10-08T16:01:02+00:00\\\">Oct 8, 2018 at 9:01am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\\\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\\\"></script>\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"FINALLY!!! IT IS HERE!!! That means I care about you guys a lot!\\n\\nI want to change your life one by one. One life after another. One broken heart after another. I have a cure for your wounds, girls. I have it!! I committed to heal your scars of every woman out there, because I feel your suffering. \\nAnd I am on the mission to change your set of mind - kinda pass my knowledge into you ultimately transforming and rebooting your mentality. (not painful - actually lots of fun and no surgery involved).\\nFull disclosure: I am always a bad cop. And I use shock therapy.\\n\\nThe goal is not give you a fish and feed you with meaningless quotes from some database and give you affirmations and let you go with blessing. I will teach you how to fish. Meaning you will be able to think rationally about who is good Enough and who hasn't gotten there. \\n\\nThe main outcome of this program is my philosophy becomes yours organically. That is the reason why I am not preaching to convert - I expect on the program already converted (meaning you kinda get it and kinda like it). Speaking of which - I am not there to use dogma as an explanation of how the life works. It is the job of religion. I am coming from a different species which were stuck in that matrix (aka simulation - That is another story - I will tell you all about it if you'd like me to). I like to explain things colorfully, not just accept them because they are coming from the Bible. I take a bible or any other scripture and use reasoning and scientific knowledge and explain the legitimacy of the dogmatic claim with my personal magic (working term - you will see what I mean when I do). I connect the dots - I make sense.\\n\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"Here is where the fun starts. I will be an investigator, a nasty one. I will need a background story of each of you. And don't you worry - I have KGB memory - I don't need any database. So FIRST MONTH of me of asking you difficult questions will be FREE.\\n\\n\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"\\n# Rules:\\n1. Yes. It is that long of a program. Some girl asked - could I just skip dating and go straight to serious relationships? No. It is part and the rule. You don't like it - you are not a good fit for the program! \\n2. No sex, hookups in closets, living together, test drive or free wife trial before the marriage!\\n3. Noone can take your breath away within 3 months even 6 months! A man starts from \\\"a boring nerd\\\" and can grow to become Good Enough after a month of dating. You are a picky Woman.   \\n4. Dating at least 3 lucky guys at a time. I will have lectures on where you can meet a nobel man and why it is important to date 3 at a time. \\n5. You will have to do your reading of articles and some other material I will be sending you. And I will also ask you to do some tasks that you will need to perforn and tell me next time I see you how it went.\\n\\n# Phases:\\n1. We will be working on our worth, self esteem which society lowered since we went to a kindergarden. We learned to live in the man's world and play by their rules - we become equal. Then why is this girl is crying her eyes out because he dumped her, and the guy is bragging about dumping her? We should all explore our sexuality - but why does it hurt so bad... \\n2. We will have each other in order to lift each other up. With the power of technology will have technology you can reach me any time and quigly ask super important question of emergency. If you feel like \\\"I saw him and it was the love from the firts side\\\" - this is definetly an emergency. Not be fooled - call me. It is safer. \\n3. Please write some memorable events that happenned between our sessions. It can be inspiration or an abscure guy... So we can clear him. Like a scanner. \\n4. Dating, emotional harmony, relationships of souls, engagement and the wedding.THAT IS THE PLAN.\\n5. I will be giving you non traditional exercises that should become your daily routine. No. Those are not to repeating the generic quotes in front of the mirror for 2 hors. Everything I produce original and from the heart and again - I will act as magic. \\n\\n# Format of our work:  \\nGood news: I want to be honest and make it like a journey, where people from all over the world coming together and trying to solve the same problem. And they become friends. \\n\\nBad news: Unfortunately world runs on money. It is a long program and your commitment and dedication. It is a lot of work for me and even bigger commitment for me, because i have to do my homework, read, wright and amuse you. \\n\\n- First month is free which consists of first intake face to face where I learn about your background and we get to know each other. \\n- And after the first seccion you will get homework (yes - already). \\n- We will meet twice a month. 1,5-2 hours of practical advice, those rules of life that I learned from scriptures and from being an evolutionary biologist. Life hack course. \\n\\n\\n# Why Am I doing that?\\n\\nDon't think that the small fee for a membership that will change your life is a loss, it is an investment into your carefree protected life with beloved husband. I think, career coaches for women, people who tell you that you are enough and you can build an empire is not the right pathway for a woman to choose. Moreover it sends you to the path of great unhappiness. (sorry career coaches - but you only make men happy). I offer you to fulfill all desires of your heart - motherhood, empire, a husband who would take care of your, your kids and your elderly parents and you have to have only one qualification - to be a woman. And willingness to become the biggest inspiration for your husband. \\n\\nI started this not because I love money more than people. But the money always comes up. I value relationship more than money. ANd I would like to see you as divine creatures, not how many dollars I can make from each of you by selling high ticket programs. I want thriving community of women finally reclaiming their place in the world. And if everyone will be on its place and do what ever brings joy - that is called happiness. \\n\\n# How much: \\n## 60$ per month. First month FREE. Monthly price includes 2 meetings 2 hours each where I will have a topic each time and fill you with useful information like.\\n- Differences between men and women on biological level and spiritual. Illusions of women regarding love. How to make your man the man of honor by being the inspiration for him. Warning signs this man is destroying you. 14 Questions you need ask before the wedding day. Stages of building relationships. 6 Steps To Increase Female Self Esteem. 30 habits you need to leave behind moving forward to a happy marriage. 10 myths about sex. How to protect your man from being irresponsible. 10 Qualities of a good Man. 9 women's silly mistakes that can become lethal for the family. \\n\\n# [BOOK THE TIME WITH ME](http://) \\n# Here is my promise: \\n- if you don't like me or what I talk about or any of those rules. You can drop out after first month no problem.\\n- if you would like to freeze your membership - and go to spiritual retreat, practice belly dance, get 2 massages per day to increase your feminine energy, or take a long walk to himallaii. \\n- if you want to stop at any point and never hear from me again. I call it a split. You get no more charges. Life goes on.\\n- and if by the end of the year there is no improvement in your self esteem, quality and quantity of your male friends, if noone proposed to you by the end of the year. Or you haven't gone to the stage of relationship of the souls. That means I did not deliver on the promise - I would be happy to give you all money back. \\n- I am not who would dreams to sell high ticket coaching programs. I seriously feel the pain of women who haven't been educated on who they are. And that will make the world as a better place. And not hight ticket coaching.  \\n- Just let's make the most out of it. Be kind to each other. And enjoy the ride. I am going to entertain you. It will be fun.  \"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"<!-- Calendly inline widget begin -->\\n<div class=\\\"calendly-inline-widget\\\" data-url=\\\"https://calendly.com/irinabulygina/120\\\" style=\\\"min-width:320px;height:580px;\\\"></div>\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\" src=\\\"https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.js\\\"></script>\\n<!-- Calendly inline widget end -->\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[10,1],[10,2],[10,3],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","created_at_ts":1542961299538,"created_at":"2018-11-23T08:21:39.000Z"},{"id":"5bf7b8fcf8e5703fc27962f3","post_id":"5be2924c297406512b26ea77","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"<blockquote class=\\\"instagram-media\\\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BorZXsaArVl/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\\\" data-instgrm-version=\\\"12\\\" style=\\\" background:#FFF;

If a man is thoughts and ideas, a woman is their embodiment. If a pure and faithful wife believes in her man. But if she is jaded, unhappy and unsatisfied with him – his is simply doomed to succeed. Creator kills his own creation instead of making it a masterpiece. A woman with a healthy woman’s energy has the gift to put into his head any ideas and visions that he will later turn into live. That’s why, the thought of a woman is equated with the action of a man. But only, of course, if she is devoted to her man, sincerely believes in him, knows how to serve selflessly. Women’s energy is able to save or kill. It is good for a husband to be under protection of an energetically strong woman. And even at a distance, this defense is very powerful. #becomehappy #findingpurpose #findingpeace #findinghappiness #findingyourself #selflovefirst❤ #selfloveisthebestlove😘 #selflovejourney🌷 #harmonyisthesourceofbeauty #beyourownbeloved #youaretheone #yourlifeisyourart #youaretheprincess #youaretheuniverse #youarethereason #yourwayofthinking #yourchoiceyourlife #yourwayoflife #yourvalue #innerlight #blessallpeople #femalepower #divineenergy #pureabsolutebeauty #acceptyourgreatness #divinelight #divinepurpose #divinepowers #datingyourself</a></p> <p style=\\\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\\\">A post shared by <a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/chiefdatingofficer/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\\\" style=\\\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> Date like noone else</a> (@chiefdatingofficer) on <time style=\\\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\\\" datetime=\\\"2018-10-08T16:01:02+00:00\\\">Oct 8, 2018 at 9:01am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\\\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\\\"></script>\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"FINALLY!!! IT IS HERE!!! That means I care about you guys a lot!\\n\\nI want to change your life one by one. One life after another. One broken heart after another. I have a cure for your wounds, girls. I have it!! I committed to heal your scars of every woman out there, because I feel your suffering. \\nAnd I am on the mission to change your set of mind - kinda pass my knowledge into you ultimately transforming and rebooting your mentality. (not painful - actually lots of fun and no surgery involved).\\nFull disclosure: I am always a bad cop. And I use shock therapy.\\n\\nThe goal is not give you a fish and feed you with meaningless quotes from some database and give you affirmations and let you go with blessing. I will teach you how to fish. Meaning you will be able to think rationally about who is good Enough and who hasn't gotten there. \\n\\nThe main outcome of this program is my philosophy becomes yours organically. That is the reason why I am not preaching to convert - I expect on the program already converted (meaning you kinda get it and kinda like it). Speaking of which - I am not there to use dogma as an explanation of how the life works. It is the job of religion. I am coming from a different species which were stuck in that matrix (aka simulation - That is another story - I will tell you all about it if you'd like me to). I like to explain things colorfully, not just accept them because they are coming from the Bible. I take a bible or any other scripture and use reasoning and scientific knowledge and explain the legitimacy of the dogmatic claim with my personal magic (working term - you will see what I mean when I do). I connect the dots - I make sense.\\n\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"Here is where the fun starts. I will be an investigator, a nasty one. I will need a background story of each of you. And don't you worry - I have KGB memory - I don't need any database. So FIRST MONTH of me of asking you difficult questions will be FREE.\\n\\n\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"\\n# Rules:\\n1. Yes. It is that long of a program. Some girl asked - could I just skip dating and go straight to serious relationships? No. It is part and the rule. You don't like it - you are not a good fit for the program! \\n2. No sex, hookups in closets, living together, test drive or free wife trial before the marriage!\\n3. Noone can take your breath away within 3 months even 6 months! A man starts from \\\"a boring nerd\\\" and can grow to become Good Enough after a month of dating. You are a picky Woman.   \\n4. Dating at least 3 lucky guys at a time. I will have lectures on where you can meet a nobel man and why it is important to date 3 at a time. \\n5. You will have to do your reading of articles and some other material I will be sending you. And I will also ask you to do some tasks that you will need to perforn and tell me next time I see you how it went.\\n\\n# Phases:\\n1. We will be working on our worth, self esteem which society lowered since we went to a kindergarden. We learned to live in the man's world and play by their rules - we become equal. Then why is this girl is crying her eyes out because he dumped her, and the guy is bragging about dumping her? We should all explore our sexuality - but why does it hurt so bad... \\n2. We will have each other in order to lift each other up. With the power of technology will have technology you can reach me any time and quigly ask super important question of emergency. If you feel like \\\"I saw him and it was the love from the firts side\\\" - this is definetly an emergency. Not be fooled - call me. It is safer. \\n3. Please write some memorable events that happenned between our sessions. It can be inspiration or an abscure guy... So we can clear him. Like a scanner. \\n4. Dating, emotional harmony, relationships of souls, engagement and the wedding.THAT IS THE PLAN.\\n5. I will be giving you non traditional exercises that should become your daily routine. No. Those are not to repeating the generic quotes in front of the mirror for 2 hors. Everything I produce original and from the heart and again - I will act as magic. \\n\\n# Format of our work:  \\nGood news: I want to be honest and make it like a journey, where people from all over the world coming together and trying to solve the same problem. And they become friends. \\n\\nBad news: Unfortunately world runs on money. It is a long program and your commitment and dedication. It is a lot of work for me and even bigger commitment for me, because i have to do my homework, read, wright and amuse you. \\n\\n- First month is free which consists of first intake face to face where I learn about your background and we get to know each other. \\n- And after the first seccion you will get homework (yes - already). \\n- We will meet twice a month. 1,5-2 hours of practical advice, those rules of life that I learned from scriptures and from being an evolutionary biologist. Life hack course. \\n\\n\\n# Why Am I doing that?\\n\\nDon't think that the small fee for a membership that will change your life is a loss, it is an investment into your carefree protected life with beloved husband. I think, career coaches for women, people who tell you that you are enough and you can build an empire is not the right pathway for a woman to choose. Moreover it sends you to the path of great unhappiness. (sorry career coaches - but you only make men happy). I offer you to fulfill all desires of your heart - motherhood, empire, a husband who would take care of your, your kids and your elderly parents and you have to have only one qualification - to be a woman. And willingness to become the biggest inspiration for your husband. \\n\\nI started this not because I love money more than people. But the money always comes up. I value relationship more than money. ANd I would like to see you as divine creatures, not how many dollars I can make from each of you by selling high ticket programs. I want thriving community of women finally reclaiming their place in the world. And if everyone will be on its place and do what ever brings joy - that is called happiness. \\n\\n# How much: \\n## 60$ per month. First month FREE. Monthly price includes 2 meetings 2 hours each where I will have a topic each time and fill you with useful information like.\\n- Differences between men and women on biological level and spiritual. Illusions of women regarding love. How to make your man the man of honor by being the inspiration for him. Warning signs this man is destroying you. 14 Questions you need ask before the wedding day. Stages of building relationships. 6 Steps To Increase Female Self Esteem. 30 habits you need to leave behind moving forward to a happy marriage. 10 myths about sex. How to protect your man from being irresponsible. 10 Qualities of a good Man. 9 women's silly mistakes that can become lethal for the family. \\n\\n# [[BOOK THE TIME WITH ME]](http://) # [[BOOK THE TIME WITH ME]](http://) \\n# Here is my promise: \\n- if you don't like me or what I talk about or any of those rules. You can drop out after first month no problem.\\n- if you would like to freeze your membership - and go to spiritual retreat, practice belly dance, get 2 massages per day to increase your feminine energy, or take a long walk to himallaii. \\n- if you want to stop at any point and never hear from me again. I call it a split. You get no more charges. Life goes on.\\n- and if by the end of the year there is no improvement in your self esteem, quality and quantity of your male friends, if noone proposed to you by the end of the year. Or you haven't gone to the stage of relationship of the souls. That means I did not deliver on the promise - I would be happy to give you all money back. \\n- I am not who would dreams to sell high ticket coaching programs. I seriously feel the pain of women who haven't been educated on who they are. And that will make the world as a better place. And not hight ticket coaching.  \\n- Just let's make the most out of it. Be kind to each other. And enjoy the ride. I am going to entertain you. It will be fun.  \"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"<!-- Calendly inline widget begin -->\\n<div class=\\\"calendly-inline-widget\\\" data-url=\\\"https://calendly.com/irinabulygina/120\\\" style=\\\"min-width:320px;height:580px;\\\"></div>\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\" src=\\\"https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.js\\\"></script>\\n<!-- Calendly inline widget end -->\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[10,1],[10,2],[10,3],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","created_at_ts":1542961404500,"created_at":"2018-11-23T08:23:24.000Z"},{"id":"5bf7b92ef8e5703fc27962f4","post_id":"5be2924c297406512b26ea77","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"<blockquote class=\\\"instagram-media\\\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BorZXsaArVl/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\\\" data-instgrm-version=\\\"12\\\" style=\\\" background:#FFF;

If a man is thoughts and ideas, a woman is their embodiment. If a pure and faithful wife believes in her man. But if she is jaded, unhappy and unsatisfied with him – his is simply doomed to succeed. Creator kills his own creation instead of making it a masterpiece. A woman with a healthy woman’s energy has the gift to put into his head any ideas and visions that he will later turn into live. That’s why, the thought of a woman is equated with the action of a man. But only, of course, if she is devoted to her man, sincerely believes in him, knows how to serve selflessly. Women’s energy is able to save or kill. It is good for a husband to be under protection of an energetically strong woman. And even at a distance, this defense is very powerful. #becomehappy #findingpurpose #findingpeace #findinghappiness #findingyourself #selflovefirst❤ #selfloveisthebestlove😘 #selflovejourney🌷 #harmonyisthesourceofbeauty #beyourownbeloved #youaretheone #yourlifeisyourart #youaretheprincess #youaretheuniverse #youarethereason #yourwayofthinking #yourchoiceyourlife #yourwayoflife #yourvalue #innerlight #blessallpeople #femalepower #divineenergy #pureabsolutebeauty #acceptyourgreatness #divinelight #divinepurpose #divinepowers #datingyourself</a></p> <p style=\\\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\\\">A post shared by <a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/chiefdatingofficer/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\\\" style=\\\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> Date like noone else</a> (@chiefdatingofficer) on <time style=\\\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\\\" datetime=\\\"2018-10-08T16:01:02+00:00\\\">Oct 8, 2018 at 9:01am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\\\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\\\"></script>\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"FINALLY!!! IT IS HERE!!! That means I care about you guys a lot!\\n\\nI want to change your life one by one. One life after another. One broken heart after another. I have a cure for your wounds, girls. I have it!! I committed to heal your scars of every woman out there, because I feel your suffering. \\nAnd I am on the mission to change your set of mind - kinda pass my knowledge into you ultimately transforming and rebooting your mentality. (not painful - actually lots of fun and no surgery involved).\\nFull disclosure: I am always a bad cop. And I use shock therapy.\\n\\nThe goal is not give you a fish and feed you with meaningless quotes from some database and give you affirmations and let you go with blessing. I will teach you how to fish. Meaning you will be able to think rationally about who is good Enough and who hasn't gotten there. \\n\\nThe main outcome of this program is my philosophy becomes yours organically. That is the reason why I am not preaching to convert - I expect on the program already converted (meaning you kinda get it and kinda like it). Speaking of which - I am not there to use dogma as an explanation of how the life works. It is the job of religion. I am coming from a different species which were stuck in that matrix (aka simulation - That is another story - I will tell you all about it if you'd like me to). I like to explain things colorfully, not just accept them because they are coming from the Bible. I take a bible or any other scripture and use reasoning and scientific knowledge and explain the legitimacy of the dogmatic claim with my personal magic (working term - you will see what I mean when I do). I connect the dots - I make sense.\\n\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"Here is where the fun starts. I will be an investigator, a nasty one. I will need a background story of each of you. And don't you worry - I have KGB memory - I don't need any database. So FIRST MONTH of me of asking you difficult questions will be FREE.\\n\\n\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"\\n# Rules:\\n1. Yes. It is that long of a program. Some girl asked - could I just skip dating and go straight to serious relationships? No. It is part and the rule. You don't like it - you are not a good fit for the program! \\n2. No sex, hookups in closets, living together, test drive or free wife trial before the marriage!\\n3. Noone can take your breath away within 3 months even 6 months! A man starts from \\\"a boring nerd\\\" and can grow to become Good Enough after a month of dating. You are a picky Woman.   \\n4. Dating at least 3 lucky guys at a time. I will have lectures on where you can meet a nobel man and why it is important to date 3 at a time. \\n5. You will have to do your reading of articles and some other material I will be sending you. And I will also ask you to do some tasks that you will need to perforn and tell me next time I see you how it went.\\n\\n# Phases:\\n1. We will be working on our worth, self esteem which society lowered since we went to a kindergarden. We learned to live in the man's world and play by their rules - we become equal. Then why is this girl is crying her eyes out because he dumped her, and the guy is bragging about dumping her? We should all explore our sexuality - but why does it hurt so bad... \\n2. We will have each other in order to lift each other up. With the power of technology will have technology you can reach me any time and quigly ask super important question of emergency. If you feel like \\\"I saw him and it was the love from the firts side\\\" - this is definetly an emergency. Not be fooled - call me. It is safer. \\n3. Please write some memorable events that happenned between our sessions. It can be inspiration or an abscure guy... So we can clear him. Like a scanner. \\n4. Dating, emotional harmony, relationships of souls, engagement and the wedding.THAT IS THE PLAN.\\n5. I will be giving you non traditional exercises that should become your daily routine. No. Those are not to repeating the generic quotes in front of the mirror for 2 hors. Everything I produce original and from the heart and again - I will act as magic. \\n\\n# Format of our work:  \\nGood news: I want to be honest and make it like a journey, where people from all over the world coming together and trying to solve the same problem. And they become friends. \\n\\nBad news: Unfortunately world runs on money. It is a long program and your commitment and dedication. It is a lot of work for me and even bigger commitment for me, because i have to do my homework, read, wright and amuse you. \\n\\n- First month is free which consists of first intake face to face where I learn about your background and we get to know each other. \\n- And after the first seccion you will get homework (yes - already). \\n- We will meet twice a month. 1,5-2 hours of practical advice, those rules of life that I learned from scriptures and from being an evolutionary biologist. Life hack course. \\n\\n\\n# Why Am I doing that?\\n\\nDon't think that the small fee for a membership that will change your life is a loss, it is an investment into your carefree protected life with beloved husband. I think, career coaches for women, people who tell you that you are enough and you can build an empire is not the right pathway for a woman to choose. Moreover it sends you to the path of great unhappiness. (sorry career coaches - but you only make men happy). I offer you to fulfill all desires of your heart - motherhood, empire, a husband who would take care of your, your kids and your elderly parents and you have to have only one qualification - to be a woman. And willingness to become the biggest inspiration for your husband. \\n\\nI started this not because I love money more than people. But the money always comes up. I value relationship more than money. ANd I would like to see you as divine creatures, not how many dollars I can make from each of you by selling high ticket programs. I want thriving community of women finally reclaiming their place in the world. And if everyone will be on its place and do what ever brings joy - that is called happiness. \\n\\n# How much: \\n## 60$ per month. First month FREE. Monthly price includes 2 meetings 2 hours each where I will have a topic each time and fill you with useful information like.\\n- Differences between men and women on biological level and spiritual. Illusions of women regarding love. How to make your man the man of honor by being the inspiration for him. Warning signs this man is destroying you. 14 Questions you need ask before the wedding day. Stages of building relationships. 6 Steps To Increase Female Self Esteem. 30 habits you need to leave behind moving forward to a happy marriage. 10 myths about sex. How to protect your man from being irresponsible. 10 Qualities of a good Man. 9 women's silly mistakes that can become lethal for the family. \\n\\n# Here is my promise: \\n- if you don't like me or what I talk about or any of those rules. You can drop out after first month no problem.\\n- if you would like to freeze your membership - and go to spiritual retreat, practice belly dance, get 2 massages per day to increase your feminine energy, or take a long walk to himallaii. \\n- if you want to stop at any point and never hear from me again. I call it a split. You get no more charges. Life goes on.\\n- and if by the end of the year there is no improvement in your self esteem, quality and quantity of your male friends, if noone proposed to you by the end of the year. Or you haven't gone to the stage of relationship of the souls. That means I did not deliver on the promise - I would be happy to give you all money back. \\n- I am not who would dreams to sell high ticket coaching programs. I seriously feel the pain of women who haven't been educated on who they are. And that will make the world as a better place. And not hight ticket coaching.  \\n- Just let's make the most out of it. Be kind to each other. And enjoy the ride. I am going to entertain you. It will be fun.  \"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"<!-- Calendly inline widget begin -->\\n<div class=\\\"calendly-inline-widget\\\" data-url=\\\"https://calendly.com/irinabulygina/120\\\" style=\\\"min-width:320px;height:580px;\\\"></div>\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\" src=\\\"https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.js\\\"></script>\\n<!-- Calendly inline widget end -->\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[10,1],[10,2],[10,3],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","created_at_ts":1542961454086,"created_at":"2018-11-23T08:24:14.000Z"},{"id":"5bf7e203f8e5703fc27962f5","post_id":"5bf72955f8e5703fc27962ad","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"<div id=\\\"amzn-assoc-ad-a343cf80-8125-4d72-9331-b96bf554d7c6\\\"></div><script async src=\\\"//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&adInstanceId=a343cf80-8125-4d72-9331-b96bf554d7c6\\\"></script>\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"h2\",[[0,[],0,\"Are You De-Manning a Man?\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"A few nights ago, I had a conversation about the marital problems of a friend of mine was having with her husband.

If a man is thoughts and ideas, a woman is their embodiment. If a pure and faithful wife believes in her man. But if she is jaded, unhappy and unsatisfied with him – his is simply doomed to succeed. Creator kills his own creation instead of making it a masterpiece. A woman with a healthy woman’s energy has the gift to put into his head any ideas and visions that he will later turn into live. That’s why, the thought of a woman is equated with the action of a man. But only, of course, if she is devoted to her man, sincerely believes in him, knows how to serve selflessly. Women’s energy is able to save or kill. It is good for a husband to be under protection of an energetically strong woman. And even at a distance, this defense is very powerful. #becomehappy #findingpurpose #findingpeace #findinghappiness #findingyourself #selflovefirst❤ #selfloveisthebestlove😘 #selflovejourney🌷 #harmonyisthesourceofbeauty #beyourownbeloved #youaretheone #yourlifeisyourart #youaretheprincess #youaretheuniverse #youarethereason #yourwayofthinking #yourchoiceyourlife #yourwayoflife #yourvalue #innerlight #blessallpeople #femalepower #divineenergy #pureabsolutebeauty #acceptyourgreatness #divinelight #divinepurpose #divinepowers #datingyourself</a></p> <p style=\\\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\\\">A post shared by <a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/chiefdatingofficer/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\\\" style=\\\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> Date like noone else</a> (@chiefdatingofficer) on <time style=\\\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\\\" datetime=\\\"2018-10-08T16:01:02+00:00\\\">Oct 8, 2018 at 9:01am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\\\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\\\"></script>\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"FINALLY!!! IT IS HERE!!! That means I care about you guys a lot!\\n\\nI want to change your life one by one. One life after another. One broken heart after another. I have a cure for your wounds, girls. I have it!! I committed to heal your scars of every woman out there, because I feel your suffering. \\nAnd I am on the mission to change your set of mind - kinda pass my knowledge into you ultimately transforming and rebooting your mentality. (not painful - actually lots of fun and no surgery involved).\\nFull disclosure: I am always a bad cop. And I use shock therapy.\\n\\nThe goal is not give you a fish and feed you with meaningless quotes from some database and give you affirmations and let you go with blessing. I will teach you how to fish. Meaning you will be able to think rationally about who is good Enough and who hasn't gotten there. \\n\\nThe main outcome of this program is my philosophy becomes yours organically. That is the reason why I am not preaching to convert - I expect on the program already converted (meaning you kinda get it and kinda like it). Speaking of which - I am not there to use dogma as an explanation of how the life works. It is the job of religion. I am coming from a different species which were stuck in that matrix (aka simulation - That is another story - I will tell you all about it if you'd like me to). I like to explain things colorfully, not just accept them because they are coming from the Bible. I take a bible or any other scripture and use reasoning and scientific knowledge and explain the legitimacy of the dogmatic claim with my personal magic (working term - you will see what I mean when I do). I connect the dots - I make sense.\\n\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"Here is where the fun starts. I will be an investigator, a nasty one. I will need a background story of each of you. And don't you worry - I have KGB memory - I don't need any database. So FIRST MONTH of me of asking you difficult questions will be FREE.\\n\\n\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"\\n# Rules:\\n1. Yes. It is that long of a program. Some girl asked - could I just skip dating and go straight to serious relationships? No. It is part and the rule. You don't like it - you are not a good fit for the program! \\n2. No sex, hookups in closets, living together, test drive or free wife trial before the marriage!\\n3. Noone can take your breath away within 3 months even 6 months! A man starts from \\\"a boring nerd\\\" and can grow to become Good Enough after a month of dating. You are a picky Woman.   \\n4. Dating at least 3 lucky guys at a time. I will have lectures on where you can meet a nobel man and why it is important to date 3 at a time. \\n5. You will have to do your reading of articles and some other material I will be sending you. And I will also ask you to do some tasks that you will need to perforn and tell me next time I see you how it went.\\n\\n# Phases:\\n1. We will be working on our worth, self esteem which society lowered since we went to a kindergarden. We learned to live in the man's world and play by their rules - we become equal. Then why is this girl is crying her eyes out because he dumped her, and the guy is bragging about dumping her? We should all explore our sexuality - but why does it hurt so bad... \\n2. We will have each other in order to lift each other up. With the power of technology will have technology you can reach me any time and quigly ask super important question of emergency. If you feel like \\\"I saw him and it was the love from the firts side\\\" - this is definetly an emergency. Not be fooled - call me. It is safer. \\n3. Please write some memorable events that happenned between our sessions. It can be inspiration or an abscure guy... So we can clear him. Like a scanner. \\n4. Dating, emotional harmony, relationships of souls, engagement and the wedding.THAT IS THE PLAN.\\n5. I will be giving you non traditional exercises that should become your daily routine. No. Those are not to repeating the generic quotes in front of the mirror for 2 hors. Everything I produce original and from the heart and again - I will act as magic. \\n\\n# Format of our work:  \\nGood news: I want to be honest and make it like a journey, where people from all over the world coming together and trying to solve the same problem. And they become friends. \\n\\nBad news: Unfortunately world runs on money. It is a long program and your commitment and dedication. It is a lot of work for me and even bigger commitment for me, because i have to do my homework, read, wright and amuse you. \\n\\n- First month is free which consists of first intake face to face where I learn about your background and we get to know each other. \\n- And after the first seccion you will get homework (yes - already). \\n- We will meet twice a month. 2 hours of practical advice, those rules of life that I learned from scriptures and from being an evolutionary biologist. Life hack course. If you need to meet more time with me - we can arrange it. \\n\\n\\n# Why Am I doing that?\\n\\nDon't think that the small fee for a membership that will change your life is a loss, it is an investment into your carefree protected life with beloved husband. I think, career coaches for women, people who tell you that you are enough and you can build an empire is not the right pathway for a woman to choose. Moreover it sends you to the path of great unhappiness. (sorry career coaches - but you only make men happy). I offer you to fulfill all desires of your heart - motherhood, empire, a husband who would take care of your, your kids and your elderly parents and you have to have only one qualification - to be a woman. And willingness to become the biggest inspiration for your husband. \\n\\nI started this not because I love money more than people. But the money always comes up. I value relationship more than money. ANd I would like to see you as divine creatures, not how many dollars I can make from each of you by selling high ticket programs. I want thriving community of women finally reclaiming their place in the world. And if everyone will be on its place and do what ever brings joy - that is called happiness. \\n\\n# How much: \\n###### 40$ for 2 hour session.\\n- Differences between men and women on biological level and spiritual. Illusions of women regarding love. How to make your man the man of honor by being the inspiration for him. Warning signs this man is destroying you. 14 Questions you need ask before the wedding day. Stages of building relationships. 6 Steps To Increase Female Self Esteem. 30 habits you need to leave behind moving forward to a happy marriage. 10 myths about sex. How to protect your man from being irresponsible. 10 Qualities of a good Man. 9 women's silly mistakes that can become lethal for the family. \\n\\n# Here is my promise: \\n- if you don't like me or what I talk about or any of those rules. You can drop out after first month no problem.\\n- if you would like to freeze your membership - and go to spiritual retreat, practice belly dance, get 2 massages per day to increase your feminine energy, or take a long walk to himallaii. \\n- if you want to stop at any point and never hear from me again. I call it a split. You get no more charges. Life goes on.\\n- and if by the end of the year there is no improvement in your self esteem, quality and quantity of your male friends, if noone proposed to you by the end of the year. Or you haven't gone to the stage of relationship of the souls. That means I did not deliver on the promise - I would be happy to give you all money back. \\n- I am not who would dreams to sell high ticket coaching programs. I seriously feel the pain of women who haven't been educated on who they are. And that will make the world as a better place. And not hight ticket coaching.  \\n- Just let's make the most out of it. Be kind to each other. And enjoy the ride. I am going to entertain you. It will be fun.  \"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"<!-- Calendly inline widget begin -->\\n<div class=\\\"calendly-inline-widget\\\" data-url=\\\"https://calendly.com/irinabulygina/120\\\" style=\\\"min-width:320px;height:580px;\\\"></div>\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\" src=\\\"https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.js\\\"></script>\\n<!-- Calendly inline widget end -->\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[10,1],[10,2],[10,3],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","created_at_ts":1544401741234,"created_at":"2018-12-10T00:29:01.000Z"},{"id":"5c123f49c996e11ec1ae2c2a","post_id":"5bf71f8df8e5703fc2796292","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"What kind of lessons about the world did you learn from your “beloved”mother?

And all your life you are fighting with ephemeral demon planted by your mother. Verbal aggression literally changes the structure of the developing brain. Parents manage a small world in which the daughter grows from infancy to childhood; the conditions of this world are established by parents, they decide with whom, how, when and how much the child will communicate. The daughter not only relies on the love and support of her mother. In this small world she absorbs “truths” about this world from her. And those absorbed truths continue to be for the rest of your life. You are an emotionally handicapped executed by your own mother.

Not exaggerating.The vase was broken not because it was wet on the sidewalk. Her malicious daughter did it, because she is stupid, clumsy and irresponsible. Her new red sweater disappeared from the shelf of the closet and this is a proof of her ingratitude, slovenliness and the fact that she does not deserve all these beautiful things.

The daughter in response could break the connection with her feelings to convince herself that she is not just a big girl, but also a good one. Daughters who have unhealthy relationships with food or have other self-destructive behaviors, such as hurting themselves, are often sign that as a child they had to hide their feelings “underground” to avoid bullying and humiliation. I was plucking my beautiful eye-lashes…Mother indeed predicted my life path… Many years after my escape from Alcatraz, I started to believe that she had a mild form of schizophrenia.

If a man is thoughts and ideas, a woman is their embodiment. If a pure and faithful wife believes in her man. But if she is jaded, unhappy and unsatisfied with him – his is simply doomed to succeed. Creator kills his own creation instead of making it a masterpiece. A woman with a healthy woman’s energy has the gift to put into his head any ideas and visions that he will later turn into live. That’s why, the thought of a woman is equated with the action of a man. But only, of course, if she is devoted to her man, sincerely believes in him, knows how to serve selflessly. Women’s energy is able to save or kill. It is good for a husband to be under protection of an energetically strong woman.

You can drop out after first month no problem.\\n- if you cannot see me on regular basis - like you went on spiritual retreat, practice belly dance, get 2 massages per day to increase your feminine energy, or take a long walk to himallaii. Let me know and we will pick up where we have left. \\n- if you want to stop at any point and never hear from me again. I call it a split. You will get refund for the months you haven't used. You get no more charges. Life goes on.\\n- and if by the end of the year there is no improvement in your self esteem, quality and quantity of your male friends, if noone proposed to you by the end of the year. Or you haven't gone to the stage of relationship of the souls.

It does not occur to him that he is bad, ugly, and his legs are too hairy. He will look at his biceps in the mirror and decide that he's just awesome. And the woman? She will not forget anything. She was abandoned, she will blame herself. Think about how a woman chooses a name for her child? She would never call him by the name of the man who offended her. If she is categorically against Matt, that means this bastard mistreated her in 1980, when they went to the third grade together. But she never forgets it. Of course, she wants \"happiness for him\", but in fact she has another mantra in her head: \"I hope you die, Matt!\"</p><p>Men, be careful, if you deeply offended one woman in Berlin, another in Moscow, and the third one in New York, then you must know: they all \"wish you happiness,\" and sooner or later this \"happiness\" will come to you. Men! Leave a women without offending her. Otherwise you will have to answer for this karmically. </p><h2 id=\"definition-of-love-from-men-s-and-women-s-perspective\"><strong>Definition of Love from men’s and women’s perspective</strong></h2><p>What does it mean to be loved for a woman? It's when someone in this world makes her wishes to come true. What does it mean to be loved for a man? When someone in this world allows him to fulfill the desires of her heart.</p><p>If it was not for the woman, the men would walk in the same uniform, no one would shave, they would all ride in black square cars and live in a tent. Men are not very fastidious creatures. They can live happily in a room measuring 2.2 x 2.4 m, and eat one and a half kilo of some \"male\" food a day. The man ate, lay down, and slept. Wise people say: \"Civilization was created by men, but they created it for women. Otherwise, they would limit themselves to beer, television and football. \" It's true. A man does not need anything for himself. Do you think a man shaves for himself? Do you think he removes hair from the bathroom for his inner peace? Because it makes a woman terribly angry. </p><p> A woman is a source of inspiration for a man. But! This does not mean that she must constantly give him something, not wanting anything in return. Things can only be given to children unconditionally. A man should want to grow for a woman. Loving him with selfless love is dangerous, because that is what makes a man irresponsible. </p><h2 id=\"problems-in-the-world-of-men-and-women\"><strong>Problems in the world of men and women</strong></h2><p>A man and a woman are faced with different problems and they solve them in different ways too. The problems of men come from outside, from society. And he ponders on these problems. He needs a quiet place, where he can think. Or he nervously smokes on the balcony. The best modern meditation for a man is switching the channels. It is important for him that something flashes. Like a bonfire in a primitive cave. Only then he solves the problem. Man receives enormous satisfaction, solving problems of women.</p><p>Woman's problems come from her head. She overcomes difficulties in the head, hence her doubts and unease. She solves problems by talking about them. Smart man listens. If a woman is wrong, then a man should take responsibility for her. After all, this is a woman, God created her like so. She requires protection. </p><p>If a woman begins to live according to the male principle - she accumulates male problems and mindset. Surely, you have met with such a woman, about whom people often say: \"A man in a skirt. Or woman with balls.\" She will stop the horse at a gallop, build the house and fix the car. This woman has too much testosterone - the hormone which makes women sick and builds muscles for a man.

But modern iconoclastic\nsociety is failing to achieve the ultimate happiness, because we choose to\nignore tradition and ancient wisdom. Why is it important to address the Vedic\nScriptures? Because it works. Everything has been invented in this world. But\nthe rules how to build healthy relationships cannot be ignored, reinvented or\nreplicated from Sex and the City or SNL. They work exactly the same way as a\nthousand years ago, five thousand years ago, a million years ago. Because it all\ncomes down to human nature. \n\nWhat you will learn from this article?\n *   What are the differences between the male and female nature and why women\n   have immense power over men;\n\n * How to be a worthy woman, from whom men do not run away;\n\n * How to build a happy relationship with a man and avoid mistakes at the\n   beginning of dating;\n\n * How to be the inspiration for your husband;\n\n * How to make a man do anything for you without you losing your mind and voice.\n\nStatistics says that in the modern world the percentage of divorces is about\n75%. And the remaining 25% is not necessarily happy, just have not yet been\nseparated. Really happy families are rare. This is not good or bad. It's just\nsuch a reality of life. Everyone, of course, decides for himself how to live.\nOnly small number of people achieves a harmony that lasts for a lifetime. Are\nthey lucky? Or they adhere to certain traditions and principles?\n\nIt seems to us that the healthy relationships between man and woman is a\ncomplete improvisation based on love. But love alone is not enough. Modern\npeople do not have knowledge about building relationships. It's not easy to\nbuild a happy family, because we do not understand that another person is not\nlike you. Women do not understand men and never learned how to be a woman. Men\ndo not know who women are and never learned how to be the man of honor. Even\nthough one gender wants to do something for the opposite one, it is not very\nclear - what, and most importantly - how. Therefore, we will begin with the\ndifferences. Knowing the difference between men and women are the key.\n\nWe are so different!\nIf you adopt a kitten, you, of course, know what kind of animal it is and what\nyou are getting yourself into. You know you'll need to buy a tray, because he\nwill not use the toilet. You will also take into account that the hair is the\nside effect of having a cat - you'll not wrap it with the tape. Sometimes it\nturns out that the cat is ill-mannered, and your guests can get an act of\nvandalism in their shoes. But you consider that behavior normal, because it is a\ncat. You will not call a police squad to arrest the cat for such vandalism. It\nis a cat!\n\nOn the other hand, you have got yourself a being of the opposite sex, why not\ntake into account its characteristics? A man will never become your girlfriend\nfrom a student dorm! You can dream that everything will be clear without saying,\nthat you will share slippers, skirts, and aromatic soap. But no!\n\nMen and women are completely different. So different that it is easier for a man\nto understand a male crocodile than a female of his own species. This truth is\neasy to hear, but hard to accept. Well, maybe the biological package looks alike\n- two hands, two legs.\n\nImagine Toyota Tundra and Ferrari. They are both cars, but they are different.\nTry to use Ferrari to transport construction materials. Is this possible? Maybe.\nBut it will not be successful. Or try to show off on the red carpet event\ndriving Toyota Tundra. I mean, you can. But it will be strange. And you will not\nmake the impression as you would with Ferrari!\n\nMen and women think differently, act differently, feel differently, suffer\ndifferently, rest in different ways, eat differently and eat different things. \n\nEmotions and Reasoning \nThe biological difference between a man and a woman is the hormones -\ntestosterone and estrogen. Even when the boy is in the womb, testosterone puts\nthe jumpers between the right and left hemispheres so the right and left\nhemispheres work alternately. The right hemisphere is responsible for the\nemotions, the left hemisphere is for rational thinking. Man can be either in the\nemotional state or in the state of reasoning. He either analyzes or loves. If he\nfocuses on love, then the P&L will not be solved.\n\nIt seems someone dropped hank of wire between right and left hemispheres in\nwomen. Her left and right hemisphere work simultaneously. And the speed of\nswitching between them is like that of a ten-core computer. \n\nTherefore, a woman and a man are complement of each other created by the\nAlmighty.  Man is pure mind, woman adds emotions. And when emotions overwhelm\nhim, she adds reason. A woman for a man is like a safety net for a circus\nacrobat.\n\nHow men and women think\nWomen are very talented. This is an indisputable fact. But the list of geniuses\nfor the most part consists of men. Why is that? Simple. A man can distance\nhimself from external stimuli, disconnect from what is not very important. It\ncan be anything, sometimes even family, children, friends. This is how the brain\nof a man works. He can think well, think badly and do not think at all about the\nloved ones. Psychologists call this effect - an \"empty box\". \n\nA woman always has something to think about, to worry about, and she cannot\ndistance herself from her thoughts. She thinks that children will starve or fall\ndown the stairs, that someone will cut off gas, electricity or water. Anything\ncan happen with her family! She does not have such a function, there is no\n\"empty box\". That's why only a woman can take care of a child. If you do not\nagree, try recalling the case when a woman went to the kindergarten for the\nchild and forgot to pick him up! Well, those incidents are not rare with men. He\nwent there, on the way saw melons, bought, forgot about the child, came home:\n\"Wife, look what a melon! let's pull the knife,\" and she said to him: \"Where are\nthe children?\". And then a tragic pause. He doesn't love his children? No! He\njust switched over and forgot about them for a while.\n\nA woman does not understand how to tell a man about her own desires and goals.\nThe false assumption is that a man should and can guess. It seems to her that if\nshe once said about her desires, he immediately remembered and all he thinks\nfrom now on is how to put it into action! Not how it works! A man is simply\nscared to say that he really did not think about her request. A woman is\noffended: \"I always think about you and you don’t! You don't love me.\"\n\nA woman can think in two positions - either good or bad. A man in three - good,\nbad or nothing at all.\n\nHow a man and a woman perceive information.\nIf a woman watches TV, she drinks tea, flips through the magazine, communicates\nwith her friends on the phone, but at the same time she understands what is\nhappening on the screen. This is normal for a woman. She can do it. A man can\nnot do two things at once. He is single-tasked!\n\nImagine a man watching television. The level of activity in the male's brain at\nthe moment of watching TV falls down to 20% of the norm. For a woman, it never\ndrops below 90%. Woman's brain practically does not rest, there is no neutral\nspeed. Therefore, a man can concentrate only on one thing.\n\nFor example, he lies down and reads a book. You come up to him and tell\nsomething important. Do you really think he hears you? It should not take a\nlifetime to understand that the man during the reading is almost death. If you\nwant to say something to a man, you should not just get him to put the book\naway, you must see lively spark in his eyes.\n\nWhy do we need each other?\nA woman can get everything in this world from her man. In other words - if a man\ncannot give something to his woman, that means it already belongs to her. But\ninstead, she is trying to get what is already hers by putting enormous efforts\nin doing so. She begins to give others what she would like to receive herself,\nhoping that this will be noticed and appreciated. This will be noticed, but not\nappreciated. It will be taken for granted. Society thinks and actively teaching\nus that man and woman are equal! So the woman herself can achieve everything! Of\ncourse, she can, but it is bad for her health and she will not be able to enjoy\nit. A woman does not have the ability to enjoy what she has achieved herself. A\nman can achieve and enjoy what he has achieved only when it is appreciated by\nsomeone. That's why he likes to be a hero for a worthy Woman, meaning for a\ngrateful Woman.\n\nA woman is born on the highest level of values, she has everything necessary for\nhappiness at birth. She has a value in itself, and her task is to live her life\nsteady. She does not need to pump her life and achieve something. The main thing\nis not to lose base complication which was given to her at birth. It's like in\nthe game World of Tanks. There is such a thing as a top tank. This tank has all\nthe best. The best gun, the best engine, the best optics. It is not necessary to\nimprove it, it is even impossible. This is the woman. If she plans to grow\nsomewhere and change something in herself, she can only grow down, because there\nis no room to grow up.\n\nA man is born on a zero level. In the world of tanks, he is a \"stock\" - he has\nthe worst caterpillars, a dead engine and an oblique cannon. Therefore, the task\nof a man is to grow, to progress. From birth to death, he changes, overcoming\ndifficulties. First as a child, he fights for his toys, at school - for a girl,\nthen for his own business ... For a man the main thing is to overcome something\nand say \"I can.\" Fall, get back up. He can fall a million times and rise. This\nis normal. Only by the age of 45 a man is formed. \n\nA woman does not need improvement, she has everything she needs for happiness at\nbirth, and unlike a man, she does not need to overcome difficulties in order to\nbecome worthy. It's enough for her to just be who she is.\n\nStress for a woman is destructive. It is great for men! What doesn't kill a man\nmakes him stronger. A man becomes a man by overcoming difficulties. A woman,\novercoming difficulties, becomes a bad man! Therefore, at all times woman needs\nto be protected from destructive excessive social activity (like work for money)\n- first by the father, then by the husband, later by the son. It's better if\nthere are no pauses in this process. \n\nA woman must always be protected by someone. If stress occurs in her life, the\nbody begins to produce the male hormone - testosterone. Testosterone means\nmuscles for a man! If a woman develops testosterone, she begins to break down\nand gets sick. This is physiology.\n\nThere must be a woman in a man's life. If man does not have woman in his life,\nhe does not progress. A real man is the one who fell twenty times and got back\nup twenty times. Pseudo, pleasure-seeking, irresponsible man is the one who fell\ntwenty times and got back up nineteen. In this case, it goes back at the level\nzero. It's just a male. Why should he change anything if life is so good?\n\nWhat prevents healthy relationships\nWhat does a man do if he needs a woman, but he does not want to grow up to her\nhigh standards and high moral values? He deprecates her. Therefore, the more\nirresponsible men are, the more devalued women are in such society.\n\nThe task of a woman is not to fall to the level of irresponsible men. She is not\ninferior to a man. Why does she need to give in to a man who is unworthy, and\nhumiliates her dignity? She is valuable by the fact she is a woman and not a\npolyp or cancer, which lives at the expense of men.\n\nIt is being said that a woman has all the qualities and brain powers to be a\nscientist, a model, a mother, a wife, a fashion designer or the greatest\nevolutionary biologist of all times at birth. And the society tells her - she\nneeds to achieve everything with sweat and tears, fight, be independent, build a\nsuccessful career in order to think about relationships with a man. And\nsometimes a career is all she is pursuing because it is all she knows. Society\ndevalues the god like nature of the woman. We never talk about that. Instead we\ntalk about achieving the best orgasms and how to be a team leader!!! All those\nmessages are coming from those men who fell 20 times and got up 19... \n\nEnergy of man and woman\nThe man is the rechargeable battery you bought in the store, but you cannot use\nit yet. It needs to be charged. A woman is a AAA battery: when you buy it in a\nstore, you just need to get the battery out of the case, and it will work. It\ncan not be recharged. Therefore, if a woman deals with irresponsible men, and\nher self-esteem falls, she can not go back to the state of \"full charge\"\nherself. She will need help to increase her self-esteem, to go back to goddess\nstate. For a woman, even the term \"self-esteem\" is not entirely correct. She\ncannot evaluate herself. Esteem always comes from outside - how other people see\nher.\n\nA man himself can rise to a high level after a fall. He can reset himself. If\nsomething happened in his life, if his beloved woman abandoned him, of course,\nhe will suffer for some time, but his self-esteem will not go anywhere. It does\nnot occur to him that he is bad, ugly, and his legs are too hairy. He will look\nat his biceps in the mirror and decide that he's just awesome. And the woman?\nShe will not forget anything. She was abandoned, she will blame herself. Think\nabout how a woman chooses a name for her child? She would never call him by the\nname of the man who offended her. If she is categorically against Matt, that\nmeans this bastard mistreated her in 1980, when they went to the third grade\ntogether. But she never forgets it. Of course, she wants \"happiness for him\",\nbut in fact she has another mantra in her head: \"I hope you die, Matt!\"\n\nMen, be careful, if you deeply offended one woman in Berlin, another in Moscow,\nand the third one in New York, then you must know: they all \"wish you\nhappiness,\" and sooner or later this \"happiness\" will come to you. Men! Leave a\nwomen without offending her. Otherwise you will have to answer for this\nkarmically. \n\nDefinition of Love from men’s and women’s perspective\nWhat does it mean to be loved for a woman? It's when someone in this world makes\nher wishes to come true. What does it mean to be loved for a man? When someone\nin this world allows him to fulfill the desires of her heart.\n\nIf it was not for the woman, the men would walk in the same uniform, no one\nwould shave, they would all ride in black square cars and live in a tent. Men\nare not very fastidious creatures. They can live happily in a room measuring 2.2\nx 2.4 m, and eat one and a half kilo of some \"male\" food a day. The man ate, lay\ndown, and slept.

They say a woman has great power. Thanks to her, a man can grow and achieve a high level in society. However, modern woman often does not try to be a woman. She simply doesn't realize her strengths and blessings as being a woman. </p><p>Look at the modern reality. We men and women are equal, we can all vote, work. But the truth is, a woman needs to give birth in the time free from exploitation, and then again back to the system to work. Then she ponders: \"Why me? Why noone loves me?\" The man at the same time sitting next to her thinks: \"Why me? I spent time and energy, and look who is next to me - soldier Jane.\" Divinity depends on how woman perceives herself and how she treats herself. If a woman thinks about herself herself as divine, she will contribute to the spiritual growth of a man.</p><h2 id=\"mantra-of-divine-feminine-woman\"><strong><strong>Mantra of Divine Feminine </strong>Woman</strong></h2><p>\"My dear, I have been given to you as a beautiful creature not just to enjoy. You need grow up spiritually, calm your mind and concentrate on achieving success for your family.\"</p><p>If a man does not encounter such woman, he will be looking for her like a burn victim is looking for a hospital. Because male nature is to satisfy his one woman. If a woman is unhappy with a man - if he is constantly between his wife and his mistresses, this does not mean that such a woman is deprived of her divine nature. That means this man is a jerk. If a man could not make a woman happy, this is the greatest misfortune for him. If she is unhappy, she can become a curse for a man, and if she is happy she is the greatest spiritual blessing for the same man. A woman, like a nuclear power plant - can give electricity, or can wipe out all humans. When a man leaves behind an unsatisfied woman, she can \"fade\" for another thirty years. Remember: a wise men when leaving a woman, try to leave her everything. So does not wish him \"happiness\" for the rest of his life.</p><h2 id=\"who-can-spoil-her-divine-nature\"><strong><strong>Who can spoil her divine nature?</strong></strong></h2><p>Who reduces female self-esteem? Only those who surround her. Work, parents, girlfriends, neighbors, boyfriends, husband. If they do not like a woman, they can ruin her divine nature. A woman with low self-esteem cannot inspire. She can not live so that man grows for her. If a woman lives for the pleasure of a man, she is full of disappointment and destruction.In addition, a woman's self-esteem falls with age, because she is exhausted, less appreciates herself, because she finds it hard to believe that she can be taken care of unconditionally. She is looking for that, but often runs into irresponsible, seeking only pleasure men.</p><p>When woman begins to respect herself, she can begin to inspire others. At the same time, she must never give more than she receives. Why? Because if a woman tries to \"earn\" herself love, then it is no different from a prostitute. If a woman is not under protection, she begins to sell herself hoping that someone will marry her. A man must protect a woman, giving more than he receives. In the scenario where \"everything is fair\" and \"all equally\", the man degrades.</p><p>A woman is loved for her achievements, but because she a woman.Do not think that a woman can give little. She is constantly thinking how to give something more to this man she is currently seeing. Let me tell you: even if she tries to do less, she will still do a lot. But if she tries to do more than she gets, her self-esteem will collapse.This rule is often manifested in the relationship of a mother and children. If a woman is lonely, she tries to perform a heroic act for children. She thinks: \"Children are flowers of life, I will give up my personal life, because I have to raise them well mannered and hard working.\" She begins to serve them at her own cost. But at some point she demands that the children pay back: \"I've put my whole life into raising you on my own.\" But in response this woman gets: \"No one asked you!\"</p><h2 id=\"how-to-awaken-her-divine-feminine-nature\"><strong><strong>How to awaken her Divine Feminine nature?</strong></strong></h2><p>Modern women have managed to archive it, so you need to get it out somehow. A Divine Feminine must choose a divine environment. If a woman wants to awaken her divine nature, she should stop communicating with those who do not treat her as divine, no matter who this is - her parents, husband, employer. Here is another secret you all wanted to hear. A woman is better not to work at all. She can only work if she really likes the process itself. In the women's work result is secondary. Pleasure is important.Male work is aimed for result. Man must turn the mountains and overcome stress. For a woman, work is stress and stress is disastrous. When she has to overcome something - her divine nature is destroyed. Even if she simply has to wake up in the morning and go to “beloved work”.</p><p>A woman should choose a pleasant environment for her and avoid a society where she is looked upon as an object of pleasure or labor.

Why would I want to work hard to become a bus\ndriver? What if I don’t work hard and do not make it to the president - do I\nnecessarily have to become a bus driver? Will I have a choice of being someone\nelse rather than becoming a bus driver? Is it who I am going to be for the rest\nof my life? Will I have a chance to meet a prince who would set me free from my\ndriver job, take it to his castle and love me? Do I even have the right to dream\nabout true love and family since I could not make it beyond being a bus driver\nand did not achieve success myself? Success necessarily makes you eligible for\nlove?\n\nLadies, when I ask those questions - my heart and soul is weeping, because we\nlive and follow rules that society (aka capitalism) created. They interfere with\nthe desires of our heart, our divine nature, with our right to be happy. Because\ndeep down every woman is dreaming about having a husband, having kids and\nfalling in love. No girl when she was little knew that her life will be so\ndifficult and she had to enter the competition in order to have her dreams come\ntrue. And sometime in order to have her dreams come true - she even has to\nbecome a bus driver. Yes. We did not know what turn our lives would take when\nall we wanted was love, family and happiness.\n\nI will go even further. Even if were given an “opportunity” to become a bus\ndriver - noone took our biological functions away and our urges to get married,\ngive birth to a child, be loving mom, wife, and a daughter. We all want them!\nBut now we need to go and deal with those opportunities: work for a living,\nbuild a career, start a company, get a PhD and get a job. We were thrown out\nthere in the wild by society to survive first. Society gave you tools to\nsurvive. You have to appreciate it. This society is operating under the\nassumption that you as a woman (while being a productive member of society\nmeaning - not relying on anyone for money) one day would want to become a mom.\nThey thought it through - some wonderful things suddenly became available to you\nlike single mom government assistance, sperm bank, affordable childcare. It does\nnot matter if it was a desire for a man to have a child or her own - it is still\nher responsibility to take care of this child. But now she has to work and trade\nher time for money instead of carrying out her primary responsibilities - taking\ncare of a child and being with her child at all times. Can you feel the pain of\nbeing single mom and working as a bus driver? And society lives by the rule - it\nis your money and not my problem. You had everything to support yourself and it\nwas your decision to have a child. Now deals with the consequences!\n\nSexism vs Chauvinism. The origins.\n\nCan a woman be undervalued and not recognized enough for her degrees, work\nethics and professional achievements. Or is it sexism? The definition of sexism\n“prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the\nbasis of sex”. Let’s take a closer look. In our thought experiment - sexism was\nused in cases when she wasn't given a promotion or a job and a guy got it\ninstead. But do we call it sexism when the job was given to the guy and he\nbecame a bus driver instead of a woman? Can you imagine having society where\nwomen are forbidden to work as a bus driver?\n\nSo where sexism came from? It is also known as chauvinism - “excessive or\nprejudiced loyalty or support for one's own cause, group, or gender”. Here I\nwould disagree that they are synonyms. Chauvinism goes way beyond the gender. We\ncan describe Nazi Germany as being chauvinistic towards all other nations. We\ncan describe straight people considering themselves not at risk of being\ninfected with HIV as chauvinistic. But those cases were disproved and dismissed.\nThe case of gender is still pending. Chauvinistic is when one group assigns for\nthemself such attributes which are imaginary, false, not true. Let’s go back to\ngender.\n\nWhy sexism is such a big deal today? When it became a thing? How we became this\nway? In order for sexism to define itself as “prejudice, stereotyping, or\ndiscrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex” women had to\nreally want to have those desires which they are being discriminated against. I\ndon’t know how this feminist paradigm took over our minds, but It had to have an\ninception. And you and I did not start the movement. We “proudly” inherited it.\nWe live the life that they were fighting for. Wouldn’t you want to conduct\nmental investigation on how did this shit happen to us?\n\nLet’s consider one scenario. Women in the past really wanted to do something so\nbad, have something on their minds that they can’t let go, and they have burning\ndesire to make this dream that stuck in their heads to come true no matter what.\nDo you believe that the burning desire of their hearts was finally being given\nthe opportunity to become a bus driver? I don’t think so. Let’s go away from the\nbus drivers. Were they dreaming about becoming the policeman and challenging men\non that? I don’t think so.\n\nWere they dreaming about an opportunity to be known for something else besides\nbeing a wife and a mother? Most likely. But, boy, those women in the past would\nhave never thought that this dream would become a reality. And the ugly one! I\ncan imagine myself dreaming about being a founder of an innovative company, a\nscientist or a doctor. And we all know what are the things women can dream about\nbecause they are so cool and we can tell them apart from things that noone even\nmen are dreaming about. Do you think that someone is dreaming about getting a\njob as a product manager at the company X? Someone might be but not because it\nwas their childhood dream, but because someone needs money very badly. So our\ndream to become special was distorted?\n\nWas there a time when women did not have to look for a job and sexism was\nirrelevant?\n\nDo you remember the time when there were no jobs for women except taking care of\nkids, husband and the house not because she was objectified, but rather because\nthere were literally no jobs for anyone! I think when hunting. Caveman age was\nreplaced by feudalism, farming and animal domestication - that is when women\nfound their first jobs besides their primary ones. And it all make sense since\nthere was no need to hunt, men decided to go to war. War became new hunting.\nEvolution created men to be cruel and eager to fight! What kind of woman would\ndecide that she needs to go to war or she is capable to fight someone. As we\nknow from history of all the great conquerors were men. Or we don’t know\nsomething about our history?\n\nThen capitalism and socialism came along dividing the world into two parts. Both\nwere equally bad for the world. But can we all agree that our history is full of\nblood and war and those were not caused or initiated by women? Those were all\nmen who like to fight by their nature. So history was driven by men.\n\nLook at the modernity - we live in the most peaceful time. No wars. But those\nmen still need to fight. That is why they go to work, or become the founders,\nthey now fight in business or politics peacefully. When you think about work -\nthink that war was replaced by modern work. And what was the war? Fight for\nresources. And what is modern work? Fight for money.\n\nWomen can become anyone they want and overcome all difficulties...\nSexism is something that does a woman - can you do that? Are you a fighter? Or\nyou are going to give up? Can you work hard and overcome every obstacle and be\npersistent in achieving your goal despite \"prejudice, stereotyping, or\ndiscrimination\"? Let me ask - pursuing what goal exactly? Can happiness be\nachieved by overcoming \"prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination\"? And we are\ntalking about women since we are trying to understand sexism and how it became\nan issue for them? What is this thing she wants so bad that she would be willing\nto go through those obstacles in order to get it? And why men do not have to\nexperience sexism?\n\nWe are now talking about work. So let’s consider scenarios in which modern women\ncan compete for a job or promotion. Again capitalism and socialism all love that\nwomen are eager to work. But if you ask women - do they really want to work? Do\nI really want to look for a job now that I am greatly passionate about but\nbecause I need money? And in today's world - everyone needs money to survive -\nmen, women, elderly, even new born! Can you imagine how difficult it is to be a\nnew-born - you not only require money and also attention 24 hours.\n\nIndeed,women have to work, they have to compete for jobs and promotions if they\nare single and noone is supporting them. But how many of those women who are\nlooking for jobs are married? Why would married woman need to look for a job or\nkeep a job after the marriage? Well, probably because we are equal and it is a\nsocial norm - to work whether you want it or not. And again people don't apply\ncritical thinking into answering the question of why would a married woman\nexchange her time for money doing something she can care less.\n\n  [https://ko-fi.com/F1F0MXYU]","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/10/freestocks-org-526361-unsplash.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"10 Undeniable Facts Feminist Propaganda is Nonsense","meta_description":"Just not so long ago I was convinced that women need to achieve success, build a career, become a leader or an innovator in order to be worthy of men.

It is a duty of schools and society to teach not about\ncontraception methods and fear mongering with STD's. This sets her for false\nbelief that she is empowered from now on and she can now go and explore her\nsexuality (aka “how to up bring the whore”). It also gives men an opportunity to\nfuck as many women as they want. Finally. Schools and parents basically saying a\nword of wisdom to young generation – here is a condom and you are now prepared\nfor life.\n\nThat is why you end up in the situation where you wanted sex and he was up to it\nbut he never wanted a child or getting his own place. You wanted a child so here\nyou go and you are welcome. “There are so many horny women out there who need my\nhelp in satisfying their sexual desire!” – he told her. And that is granted\nspirit today! Man thinks his job is to provide for himself, take good care of\nhimself, date women and give them the best sex of their life.\n\nDating is just a formality that is not even needed in most cases because women\nsee how hot he is, what a great body he has – so they want to skip the formality\nand get down to business. Because she is horny and he is hot as hell! He knows\none thing about himself – he makes every woman wet. And that is the absolute\ntruth based on his personal experience. But very unfortunate one.\n\nAll women have those high moral standards at birth to be loyal, to give love, to\nreceive protection, to give birth to a child, to take care of the family – those\nvalues were built-in by the evolution. So evolution preserved the survival of\nmankind in women. A baby – even male gender would not survive without women\ntaking care of him full-time. We are the ones who want kids. Men wants to fuck,\nfight and have a locker room talk bragging about how many women they screwed.\n\nWomen, those goddesses, who used to inspire a man to conquer continents now\nbecame free. Now those women are drinking in bars hoping to meet someone, they\nwork stressful jobs for survival, they even deserve a right to get a job as a\nbus driver and make their own money if they really want to get a child. You have\nto be entrepreneurial in order finance such a venture as a child. You can become\na lawyer or a doctor, so you can afford to such a luxury as a child.\n\nMantra of a successful woman.\nGoes as follows – I need to become independent and self reliant so no man would\ntake advantage of me. I need to grow up and realize that this pure love and\nfairy tale do not exist in reality. Even after the oath he can still cheat on\nme. Another one – what if I will be unable to suppress my horniness and will\ncheat on him! Because those are well documented stories circulating in society\nby Amy Shumer. So I have to ensure financial security for myself and my kids.\nStrong women and single moms are everywhere. We are proud of them! They are\nheroes nowadays!\n\nThere is saying that women, kids and elderly are at the same level. Those are\nvulnerable creatures and they need protection. Women became equal to men. Woman\nfocuses on the degree, career, success not because she really wants it,  because\nshe has to. Modern women were not told that she is divine, she is the driver of\nhumanity, she does not have to sell neither herself nor her time to get anything\nshe wants. She was supposed to have a husband who would take a bullet for her.\nWith whom she will be the happiest woman in the world! And those are absolutely\nattainable and viable! That is the reason why i chose to have a platform to\nspeak up.\n\nSociety betrayed women. \nToday she is in a survival mode and prince will not appear and magically solve\nher problems and love her unconditionally. Because modern women were betrayed by\nsociety. Even this simple act as sex – it is not just old school commandment\nthat sex can only happen between husband and wife. Modern women are secretly\noperating under this premise. When a woman makes love to a man she considers\nthat she is sleeping with her future husband! No matter how badly we want to\nquench our sexual fire we allegedly all have, the truth is – we are not sluts in\nour evolutionary memory and nature. We were created naive like kids! We fall in\nlove with the wrong men. Men hurt us. And we become prosperous and strong in\norder to take care of ourselves and our babies! Noone in this paradigm is\nfavorable neither men nor women.\n\nAnd evolution assigned to sex special meaning – after sex woman usually got\npregnant in old time. Today we have sex for “pleasure”. Are we trying to please\nourselves or a man? Sex became like a toilet visit. Can you not go to the\ntoilet? No. For the same reason you must have sex. And we do!\n\nWomen are exploited by society, mislead and betrayed! Women are naive and\nsociety does not provide protection! Feminists propaganda devalues them! As a\nresult we have this society where women suffer big time. In today’s world of\nsex, choices and contraception women get hurt. There is no morality left and no\nnorms. We forgot what normal is.\n\nThis society officially reports statistics of single moms! Do you think the\nreport itself will solve a problem of single moms? How about we create such\nsociety where there is no need for women to become single moms? Society where a\nsingle mom is non existent. Single mom is viewed something women really hope\nfor, looking forward to? Again – really? If you ask any single mom – would you\nrather have your childcare more affordable or have a husband who is your safety\nnet so you can stay home, have a kid and be worry free. Why is it the woman who\nhas to pay for luxury of having a child? And why we read the statistics and ok\nwith that? Because we don’t objectify women. They are free. Now they can make\nlove for pleasure, pay for the childcare and be single. Freedom!\n\n  [https://ko-fi.com/F1F0MXYU]","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/10/beauty-355157_1280-1.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"Single Moms Phenomena Is a Plaque Of Modern Society","meta_description":"When she feels like it is time for her to have a child – she gets a boyfriend, falls in love, and during the act of love making accidentally becomes pregnant.

Love arises\nunconsciously. It is a set of feelings. It is also inherent in many animals:\nthey form pairs which can exist for a very long time. Love is the quality\ninvented by evolution to ensure better life and survival of children.\n\nIn order to raise the offspring, any woman should make a man to be her for so\nlong, until the child can take good care of his food on his own. Human offspring\ndevelop very slowly compared to other biological species. Therefore, the woman\nhad to learn how to tie a man for a long time.  Evolution gave birth so-called\nbiological love. Love is a biochemical process in the body.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nLove has evolved, so a man can take care of the offspring he will receive from\nyou.\n\nThe opposite is also true.\n\nIf he wants children from you, then he is in love.\n\nWhat is maternal instinct?\nMaternal instinct is the biological connection between mother and a child. After\ngiving birth, the mother‘s instincts begin to work in a certain way. This is no\nlonger a spiritual or social affection, rather a feeling at the level of\nphysiology. The scientists conducted a barbaric experiment.

If you do not develop feelings of a man\nto a child, then they may not arise.\n\nWhere did the instinct of provider come from?\nScientists came to a strange conclusion. This instinct did not exist in the\nmales. Zoologists who watched the chimpanzee males wondered why and how they had\ndeveloped the need to bring food to the female. After all, she herself was able\nto obtain food. As a result, they came to the conclusion that the male\nchimpanzee mastered the skills of hunting in order to prove his power and\nstrength so she would choose him over the others.

No wonder there is a joke that men without women would be like a\ndecaying herd. Yes, that is right. Now it is scientifically proven.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe instinct to get food is part of the marriage foreplay. Act from the\nopposite.

That is why it was very\nimportant primal rule – many men compete for a woman by showing her their\nabilities to provide for her and her child.\n\nWhy nature needed monogamous couples?\nThey arose as a result of evolution. In a monogamous couple, the child develops\nmore balanced and healthy. Since the moment of the Homo sapiens got on their\nfeet, the birth began to be more difficult. The child’s head grows as a\nconsequence of evolution. Ss scientists now note, today women continue to choose\nmen with great ability to learn and with higher intelligence, and consequently,\nthe head will continue to increase in size. Therefore it will be more and more\ndifficult for the modern woman to tie a man for a long time, thus, this ability\nwill become even more important in the future!\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nEvery man wants to find himself a permanent pair. He can think that he is not\nready for this, that he does not require it and all that jazz. And this behavior\nwill lead him to a distressing situation. We cannot go against the laws of\nnature.\n\nWhat is male polygamy in theory and practice?\nPhysiologically men are polygamous. This is a scientific fact. Why then does\nmonogamy rule in the world?\n\nThe fact is that a man is obliged to be monogamous. In order not to cause public\ndisapproval, a man just has to hide his instincts. That’s why men are polygamous\nonly in “theory.” And in practice, most prefer to create permanent couples with\none woman.\n\nMen is monogamous for their wife. For relatives, they are monogamous in the eyes\nof society. This is their social image.\n\nPolygamy of a man is an instinct. A person has a shame and attempt to hide his\ninstincts. A man is polygamous, but he is afraid to show his instincts. He hides\nthem from his wife, children and girlfriends. He feels ashamed of his instincts.\n\nThat makes a man monogamous. Because we publicly condemn polygamous behavior.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis means that if a man says to you that he is polygamous in nature, if he\ntries to build “open relations” with you, then your importance for him is quite\nlow. He is required to fall in love with you. Even the most notorious\nscoundrels, do not wish to upset women who mean something to them! So when they\ndate (as getting to know each other not in bed) an interesting girl, we try to\nhide all of our dirty underwear and presence of any other women. They would not\nattempt to hide anything from one night stand. And they say – the men are\npolygamous, well, you know! A woman who means something to them, they try to\nprotect from this fact, showing her his “monogamous” part.\n\nWhat are your principles of choosing the male?\nYou are torn apart by diverse desires, which have different instinctive goals!\n\n1. Find a male to get the best genes.\n\n2. Find a male with whom you can raise children.\n\nA woman chooses men in two ways:\n\n1. External signs like health, appearance and skills;\n\n2. Reliability.\n\nThese selection strategies are called by scientists opposite and incompatible.\n\nAfter all, it is often very difficult to tie a very popular man, because he\nturns out to be a douchebag. You prefer to get genes from him at the level of\ninstincts without thinking about his reliability. And since evolution and\ngenetics are not aware of condoms and contraception. The desire to sleep with\nhim is the implementation of evolutionary strategy of finding the best gene.\n\n  [https://ko-fi.com/F1F0MXYU]","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/10/photo-1536786112857-207c726329a1.jpeg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"Evolution Invented Love to Make Us Better People…","meta_description":"What is love?\nlove is the human quality that distinguishes us from the animal world.

I am talking about early\nhumans. They did an amazing job back then. They survived! And it wasn’t easy.\nLet’s go back in history and have a look if we can learn something from our\nancestors. \n\nPrimitive tribe. Hierarchy. Structure of inter-sex relations.\nWhen our ancestors were relatively underdeveloped, did not have effective tools\nof labor, weapons, hunting methods, did not know farming or cattle breeding, the\nlevel of satiety and safety was no different from that of the animal. They\nperished in the teeth of predators, were dependent on harvest of wild edible\nfruits and roots. They balanced on the verge of life and death, participating in\nthe great natural conveyor of struggle for survival.\n\nBack then human community was almost no different from a herd of monkeys. Leader\nis on the top – the strongest and most aggressive male. He dominated all the\nother members of the herd. The remaining males were lined up in their position\nas a pyramidal hierarchical structure. This structure was formed as a result of\nconstant brutal skirmishes. However, in the absence of an effective natural\nweapon (fangs, horn, hooves), these conflicts rarely led to the death. For the\nsame reason, it was impossible for an individual or even a small group to leave\nthe herd. They could have become prey for predators easily. “Firmware” of human\nbrain practically was no different from the instinctive behavioral programs of\nother animal species. And this “firmware” has not gone anywhere today.\n\nNevertheless, the position of the female in such a herd was not completely the\nsame as that of the flock of animals due to the above-described specific human\ncharacteristics. The common thing was that females preferred to mate with the\nstrongest and most aggressive males by default. Natural selection is the law of\nnature.

Both sexes now, as before, are not spared from the pressure of gender roles. In addition they feel the constant pressure of stereotype about success.

In the quotations given in the Second Field, Pythagoras, Aristotle and the ideologists of the USSR, despite the 2500 years of history that separate them, are equally far from the ideas of gender equality and the change of the prevailing order. De Beauvoir clearly explains the Eurocentric world of the colonizer, which is based on the domination and repression: in this role at different times were the Greeks and Romans, the militant Christians and Enlightenment figures, the apologists of the theory of evolution and the tyrants of empires.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The logic of tyranny is traced not only to women, but also to otherness, as a result we have a linear history of beauty or a one-sided political history of the world in which the diversity of ethnic groups and cultures does not appear.

However, this process is not possible without understanding how the existing models of relations have developed, how our minds have fixed the notion of “right” or “traditional” and why changes are unavoidable.

It seems that we can talk about “new” gender roles, only if the word “extra” was not one of the most dangerous, often used and uncertain. A series about new relationships, a site for new kind of women, round tables about new men – primarily a commercial offer – surely, this “new” never existed before. Both sexes now, as before, are not spared from the pressure of gender roles. In addition they feel the constant pressure of stereotype about success. If an archetypal wife turns into a strong woman, or a conditional “wolf from Wall Street” can start working for less money and spend more time with the family, they will be pressured by the cultural dominance of preconceived notion of personal success, self-realization or inner harmony.</p><p>Is there no acceptable personal life? Then maybe you have success at work. And if not, then why are you living? Who do you want to be in five years? Choose something and follow the dream! Several times a day we go through such painful dialogues with ourselves or others and learn the “right” answers so well that we begin to believe in them ourselves. Gender roles are constructed and fixed through an orchestrated repetition of actions, as reported by Judith Butler in the book “Gender Trouble“. Repetition gives rise to repression, and habit becomes your first nature. At the beginning of the 21st century, 3-year-olds do not hesitate to answer questions about gender differences and gender behavior frankly.</p><p>Remember the “gender fuck”, which was shown by Conchita Wurst: a woman with a beard and travesty shows in the story, and cross-dressing on stage in front of the crowd. Nevertheless, the appearance of such a person on the stage of the old-fashioned contest of a nonexistent united Europe became a news item number one for a whole week. Ask any specialist from advertising: Conchita in the modern world can only sell news about himself (in the way how new is sold about any atypical behaviors). But he/she cannot sell any product, even his singing, for any longer than one season. In marketing, they do not pay money for originality, but they pay for the imitation of a friend. World sitcoms and eco-friendly gluten-free bars for residents of small towns are produced for target audiences in a fair belief that those who consider themselves like everyone and those who consider themselves special can be equally easily counted and measured – not by their heads, but by hashtags and likes.</p><h2 id=\"can-a-gender-role-be-free-choice\">Can a gender role be free choice?</h2><p>A century before Jung spoke about the presence of Animus and Anima in each person and insisted on an archetypal aptitude to be of male or female, in which there is much more public pressure than biology. And although in some societies the paradigm of life within the gender roles where the male-provider and the female – home keeper are quickly replaced by the social demands of self-realization and ideal time management.

And if you add gender to the list of choices? Lifestyle publications publish seemingly opposite but equally hysterical from “It’s time to settle down and find the right person” to “Why I don’t want to have children and I have the right to choose so!” This reflection can be gender colored or not, but it contains fears and worry about life achievements, age and way of life – the indicators that society is measured in crisis situations. “How to have everything and remain yourself” or “Why the main things in life will come after 40.” Sounds familiar?</p><h2 id=\"how-many-genders-are-there\">How many genders are there?</h2><p>Feminism of the second wave received theoretical support in 1949 in one of the main books on the female question “The Second Sex” by Simone de Beauvoir. The book is filled not only with interesting biological and historical references on the economic and social mechanisms of oppression of the additional sex, but also criticized the dominant philosophical systems: Marxism, capitalism and psychoanalysis. In the last part of the book, de Beauvoir gave a plan for women and by following it can become co-creators of the history, and not just act within the framework of given systems. Sixty-five years later, Australia officially recognized the existence of a neutral third gender, and among the nearly one billion people in India since ancient times there are about 6 million people living outside the binary gender system.

It is enough to read the ancient Indian epics or read Indian tales to find all the above concepts of gender roles: the flaw of sex and its collective representation always existed, but never received a scientific language, and therefore was ignored by the majority. Cloning, birth control, child-free movement, hormone pills from pregnancy and euthanasia pose scientific questions about who is in charge of the emergence and cessation of human life. However, at the same time, the action of a 23-year-old girl to raise money for an abortion at Kickstarter shows the real scale of “new age”.</p><p> all the visible changes in gender roles there are only two in the minds of the majority and there is no consensus as to whether such a division is fair in the near future.

Was it once in the history of mankind in a different way? This can only be left in the history in which, after hundreds of winners have rewritten it, there are still no obvious answers to questions about human self-determination.</p><h2 id=\"why-gender-roles-became-the-matter-of-politics\">Why gender roles became the matter of politics?</h2><p>In already mentioned book “The Second Sex”, Simone de Beauvoir paints a convincing story of the objectification of a woman, coming to the conclusion that “not the inferiority of women has determined her insignificant role in history, but an insignificant role of history has doomed her to inferiority.” Repeating or interpreting her judgments does not make sense: the book is written simply and yet witty and is filled with gender stereotypes and the performance of key historical figures throughout human history. In the quotations given in the Second Field, Pythagoras, Aristotle and the ideologists of the USSR, despite the 2500 years of history that separate them, are equally far from the ideas of gender equality and the change of the prevailing order. De Beauvoir clearly explains the Eurocentric world of the colonizer, which is based on the domination and repression: in this role at different times were the Greeks and Romans, the militant Christians and Enlightenment figures, the apologists of the theory of evolution and the tyrants of empires.</p><p>The logic of tyranny is traced not only to women, but also to otherness, as a result we have a linear history of beauty or a one-sided political history of the world in which the diversity of ethnic groups and cultures does not appear. The French philosopher Frantz Fanon spoke in details in his studies how colonization distorted identity and the social systems that were rare for white people and imposed their own authoritarian standards through violence. Indeed, in the supermarket of modern ideas of history and tradition of “non dominant” people are the missing piece or the most needed one, depending on the popularity of a particular supermarket.</p><h2 id=\"why-the-expansion-of-knowledge-about-the-world-has-not-changed-the-system-of-division-into-men-and-women\">Why the expansion of knowledge about the world has not changed the system of division into men and women?</h2><p>Great geographical discoveries have made with European culture the same as plowing and taming of wildlife: violence against tribes with a different ecosystem has transformed European culture carriers into rapists in their own society.

A huge number of cultures were physically exterminated.

He uses medical directories and treatises of the Reformation and the Enlightenment, which try to scientifically explain the world around – and, it must be said, their attempts do not stand up to criticism: until the middle of the 18th century women are perceived as a weak variation of a man with a clitoris instead of a developed penis and a uterus instead of a developed scrotum.

This side has long been abandoned… Let’s talk about that.</p><h2 id=\"why-should-you-go-there\">Why should you go there?</h2><p>In order to awaken your desire to carry out this trip, I suggest you look around. Now most women live in the male half of the world according to male rules. What’s happening to us there? Loneliness, chronic fatigue and insomnia…</p><p>If women move to the side they belong – they can truly feel again loved and happy.</p><p>This is precisely what each of us needs.</p><p>When women move back to female land, men will constantly notice that it is not that crowded on their side any more.

Women are simply throwing out of their heads the female thoughts. This list can go on without the end.</p><p>Modern society hung so numerous duties on our fragile shoulders. We became tough, put on the armor and just try to survive at any cost.</p><h2 id=\"who-did-we-become-what-is-the-price\">Who did we become? What is the price?</h2><p>What roles are now successfully performed by us? Isn’t it too expensive price to pay for being strong and omniscient women who are able to provide not only for herself, but also for grown up children and even for the husband?.. Countless women now earn more than their husbands. Need a vacation? No problem! Your woman can take out the whole family for a retreat. Another question is, are they able to replenish their energy levels and finally get some rest?The price we pay is sometimes too high. I have often met women who are tired of life, of heavy workload. Hunched over, looking down to the ground, she took on worries about the whole family, forgetting about rest and other joys of life. Under this unbearable weight, they are not interested in personal life, their main goal is the survival of the family.</p><p>First, they live to raise children.</p><p>Then – to look after elderly parents.</p><p>Then – in order to “raise” the grandchildren and give them what they were denied. Between all of this, women manage to work, build a career, and study a lot. For what?</p><p>In the beginning of the life journey they still hope and dream for happiness and love. Then later on they understand that life has passed and it is foolish to dream about prince and life in his mansion. Her life was tough – what makes you think that her daughter’s life will be a fairy tail. Most likely not! That is the reason why the mother is preparing her daughter to be a fighter, to be self reliant, independent very early in life. Many modern women go through the main years of life carrying the proud title – single moms. While serving others, some women suddenly hear sharp and bitter words.</p><p>– I’m tired of you…</p><h2 id=\"what-is-on-this-side\">What is on this side?</h2><p>Only on this side she realized that she lived for the sake of others, their interests and lives. Her private life ended somewhere between diapers and doing a homework with your child. The years have gone by since then, and the woman lived only to help others, proving that she is still needed and she still can be useful. The truth is – a woman needs to be loved.</p><p>There is an unspoken law on the male side of life: everything must be won or deserved!</p><p>So she deserved, and sometimes won the right to be loved.</p><p>One woman of venerable age, Doctor of Chemical Sciences, remained alone all her life and a phenomenal career. When she was about 50 years old, she made a comment about a family life:</p><p>– You want me to wash another person’s pants??…</p><p>This respected lady turned 75 years old she answered:</p><p>– I would now give up all my achievements for a child’s cry in my apartment and the man’s socks in the bathroom. Living by male standards, a woman loses what she really needs so much.</p><p>It’s hard to stop and relax.</p><p>The biological organisms of man and woman work in different ways.</p><p>The man’s body is built so that he can stop and relax after intense and stressful work.</p><p>Man uses his energy for his self-realization in society. That energy builds muscles for him. The more muscle mass – the more strength, more energy. Man can easily recover from stress and tiredness. And he is ready to go. Testosterone plays big role in keeping them being comfortable under stress. Therefore, a man can relax and rest after a hard day and be like fresh tomorrow. If he had little work load today, sleep does not come to him until he pumps his muscles. Sometimes we can hear such recommendations addressed to women…sad woman</p><p>It is not the same thing! Because they have a different energy supply system. The female body accumulates fatty tissues. They become the source of her strength. However, with a certain expenditure of energy, her body begins to experience an overload, but the woman is not required to stop, because there is still fat left in tissues. If a woman does not stop, self-destruction will occur.</p><h2 id=\"the-aura-of-the-male-and-female-body-consists-of-two-layers-\">The aura of the male and female body consists of two layers.</h2><p>Outer layer of man has a positive charge, or Yang, as it is called in the eastern philosophy. The inner layer of the masculine aura has the Yin charge, or potential. This layer allows him seriously and deeply engages in spiritual practices. The female aura is arranged in the opposite way. Outside – Yin, a potential charge. Due to this layer, the woman has a vital intuition, forebodings – to foresee a danger. The inner layer of the feminine aura has a Yang charge (+). This energy is necessary for a woman’s body to create a child’s body.</p><p>Modern woman destroys her aura by extracting the sacred Yang energy in order to find a job and to strive for survival. Nature has awarded a woman with this energy to a by investing it in the womb in order to create the child’s body. If a woman spends this energy in her social life, she loses the ability and desire to have a woman’s happiness and a child.</p><p>The outer energy layer of a woman is potential and manifests as persistent care for others. Woman naturally produces a hormone called oxytocin. If there is plenty of it, she is relaxed and happy. It eliminates stress in the feminine body. Oxytocin is recognized as a hormone of social rapprochement and is developed in women during a relaxing massage, kisses, embraces. This hormone induces motherhood instinct. It reduces blood pressure and sense of fear. In a modern society, it is important for a woman to achieve success at work, but it does not contribute to her inner peace, it only increases the level of testosterone in her body. Testosterone is produced due to stressful situations, her desire to win, the need to make decisions and make priorities. For men, testosterone is a natural condition. Testosterone is necessary for a man – it is the source of eternal fuel. Testosterone does the magic for male’s body. So the logic is men are the one who supposed to be under stress and pressure, because they come with built-in antidote – testosterone. With that logic if a man is feeling depressed, that means he is not under stress. Being under stress, fight, competition, argument is only natural for men.</p><p>Testosterone acts as antidepressant for men, but not for women. In a state of distress, she starts selflessly serve others instead of concentrating on herself and her own needs.</p><p>The skyrocketing level of testosterone in modern women makes them think that the roles of mother, caring housewife and loving wife are burdensome, uncool, not acceptable and not enough. The predominance of testosterone in the female body leads to anxiety and feeling of abandonment.</p><p>Our body, unlike the male, accumulating testosterone, loses the ability to rest. Women do not understand that and try to sort things out as soon as possible, instead of relieving stress by restoring the level of oxytocin. They think once they finish all the things they planned, they will finally rest, maybe start dating. And they not only do it themselves, but also expect the same from their husbands and children. Instead of being the source of support, her male partner turns into an additional burden for her.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-the-trade-off\">What is the trade off?</h2><p>It’s tough to relax and start believing in love and the happy life. Believe that the husband will finally start to provide for a family. It’s challenging to believe that you can be taken care of not because you have earned it, but because you are kind, full of life and the light. Can you imagine being covered with a warm blanket when you are cold, have a breakfast made for you, and someone special is telling you tender words?</p><p>Until now, you have done all of this and much more for your loved ones, expecting that they will do the same thing for you someday.</p><p>The score has not been in your favor for many years. Thousands and thousands of deeds you did for loved ones were taken for granted. Thousand and one – and then you would feel better, they will finally notice and appreciate your sacrifice for them…</p><p>However, this does not happen. Day after day you overcome fatigue, doing more and more with each and everyone.</p><p>Every day we have to get to work and compete with men, suffer, survive and fight. And guess what? We want love after we become winners. Unknowingly, we choose to struggle for the right to be known as a strong woman. We gave up female happiness in exchange for that title. Is it worth it? We got involved in a man’s game – only the winner can be considered successful. For men this is enough, but women want something else.</p><p>Successful woman may find herself in bed with not very successful man who used his strength and body to be the winner. No wonder after a good time with a woman, a man does not feel connected to her, and a woman does.</p><p>In the struggle for the first place, many women become angry, strict, harsh. God forbids bursting into tears or showing weakness… Everyone does what they have to. No one cries! There is no one out there to listen to your complaints. You can cry when no one is looking. Everyone seems to be ok with their life. I don’t see single moms are complaining about their life. And if you are single strong, successful, independent woman – what do you have to complain about? Your life is great!</p><p>Women’s weakness is perceived as a flaw and something to be ashamed of.</p><h2 id=\"it-is-just-so-difficult-to-be-a-woman-\">It is just so difficult to be a woman!</h2><p>The woman’s excellent ability to collect complete information about everything and everyone turned out to be endless torment for her. She is always dissatisfied with the fact that she feels insufficiently competent, she tortures herself with doubts, inventing her personal issues and problems. And the way she overcomes her doubts – she works hard.</p><p>This does not happen with men, because they use information for solution of a specific problem that is being solved at the moment – without allegory, specific tone, emotions and hints. Therefore, many women are surprised to see how a man who is not very knowledgeable and competent achieve rapid success with full confidence in his superiority.</p><p>We respond differently to stress and trouble.</p><p>For men silence is a rest of mind, for a woman – it is a punishment.</p><p>The woman in silence constantly thinks about what has been said, and what else needed to be said and done. Often her thinking is based on negative situations, developing a sense of bitterness and defeat.</p><p>We are taught to remain silent and think what we say, but this method is only suitable for men. A woman can think and find the long-awaited answer, only by talking about the problem.</p><p>A conversation is necessary for a woman. By talking she relieves stress and finds the right positive decision. However, talkativeness is condemned in the society of men. They learn how to speak. They know what and how they will say it.</p><p>A woman, living on the male half of the world, does not even know her advantages, opportunities, rights, privileges, duties as a female.</p><p>We are taught from the very childhood to behave like men, not showing female behavioral stereotype. Various women are not happy that they were born as women. They do not know how to live a female life and how to be happy as a female.</p><h2 id=\"when-will-this-end\">When will this end?</h2><p>Why do you think this world is so fierce? No, women have never been told what it really means to be a woman. Are you ready to go back home?</p><p>Modern society became so atomized that each of these halves considers themselves self-sufficient, independent from each other. But these two worlds cannot exist without each other.</p><p>For several decades, women have been learned to act and think like a man. They declared – women are equal to men! As a result of new paradigm men began to rule the world and dictate their rules. Both men and women are required to play by male‘s rules. The rules of the feminine half of the world were just forgotten. There was a confusion. Men and women assembled in the male half of the world and began to fight for the place under the sun.</p><h2 id=\"the-feminine-half-of-the-world-was-left-almost-uninhabited-\">The feminine half of the world was left almost uninhabited.</h2><p>Several generations have changed, and people have forgotten about the loss. They began to think that the world is very small. In this tiny world, men and women started feeling lonely and sad for no obvious reason. That happened because the knowledge about the soul and true love has been lost on the other half. The male half of the world is now densely populated, while female half of the world has only a few happy inhabitants.</p><p>Since ancient time, a woman was a guardian of the heart and the soul of her husband. Thanks to her his soul could sing. The woman herself was the SOUL of this world and the universe. Women knew a lot back then before the loss…Now, because of the overload of the male part and the small population of female one – the world became unbalanced.</p><p>Women still want love and happiness, but don’t know how awaken the man’s soul. So they apply male methods.</p><h2 id=\"everything-is-messed-up-\">Everything is messed up.</h2><p>What is the biggest desire of the female heart?</p><p>Happiness, harmony of the soul and body and, of course, the long-awaited LOVE. And to receive every blessing will not require hard work. What will be required from you instead of hard work?</p><p>• A wish</p><p>• Patience</p><p>• Aspiration</p><p>• Thirst for bliss and love</p><p>Farewell, male world!</p><p>Being in a male world all your life, you have earned your place there. You pushed, poured, defended, argued, defeated, competed, conceded. Now you chose to leave everything behind and change your life dramatically. Before you left I provide you with an overview of methods and rules society used on you to make who you are today – strong, independent, successful woman.</p><h2 id=\"in-the-beginning-it-was-joy-and-then-school-was-created\">In the beginning it was joy, and then… school was created</h2><p>You were in the same class of boys. Your teachers often criticize you in front of the whole class. They could even organize a competition between girls and boys. So girls learn to compete with boys using their brain early on in life.</p><p>The physiological growth and development of boys and girls are quite different. From an early age, the boy first has to grow and master his physical body. He runs, jumps, climbs, fights, break bones, get stitches.</p><p>This is the first phase of becoming a man. He wishes to be the best, so he must be the best. He often has fights with another boy, he feels his power and place in the world. If his opponent is also keen and clever, they can then become best friends. Having mastered and developed his male body, having got experience of skirmishes and defending his view of the world, the boy begins to engage his brain. That means that the second period of boys‘ life has begun.</p><h2 id=\"what-transformation-a-girl-undergoes-in-school\">What transformation a girl undergoes in school?</h2><p>The girls are different. Very early girls start collecting the information about the world in which she will live and raise her future children. She plays “daughter-mother” game, where the mother – Barbie is flawless beauty. Ken is her dedicated husband and together they live in a Barbie house. She dresses her Barbie in the most gorgeous dresses. Because of the girl’s imagination she is Barbie. And her life will be just like Barbie’s life. Everything will be provided for her, she just has to remain beautiful and happy. You don’t see boys playing with Barbie. While girls are playing their game, boys are testing new asphalt. Seriously, they want to find out how it tastes like…  By the time of high school. Girls collected enough information about this world to pass it on the child.They became sexually attractive, because they are ready to have kids. Boys are interested in the look of girls. Sometimes it makes it difficult for them to study…Those girls who cannot cope with the hormonal reorganization of the body and competition in school becomes typical “difficult teenagers”. Nevertheless, teachers will use all sorts of methods of influence, forcing girls to study better. Humiliation, insults, shaming in front of the entire class are common. Calling out parents to complain about their daughter only strengthens the girl‘s self-doubt. The girl closes herself from the world and really starts to notice more and more imperfections in her appearance. Here are some life principles we learned in school:</p><p>• Compete, the first is the best.</p><p>• Strive to become a winner, fight if necessary.</p><p>• Work hard to get the best marks.</p><p>• Pursue leading positions (head of the class committee).</p><p>• Learn to please teachers and those who make decisions.</p><h2 id=\"series-of-unfortunate-events-for-girls-have-just-began-\">Series of unfortunate events for girls have just began…</h2><p>This set of rules and behaviors of the masculine world was taught to girls. As a result, after finishing school or college, a girl does not have a very good opinion about herself and tries to compensate her own idea of her unattractiveness by competing with men in knowledge, workload and burning desire to reach the peak of career ladder. In fact, she learns to forget about the gorgeous looks, fashion, beauty, about everything from Barbie had. The look will not get you anything in life. However, good marks and discipline will. Now it’s time to take care of yourself and just think about your future. You have to find a job that will help you earn money and buy yourself a place to live. The pursuit of prestigious and expensive things will begin soon, because they will tell everyone about your status and success. Only then you will be in a position to declare a victory. You will have a legitimate right to be arrogant and condescending towards the losers, who engaged into family-kids matter too early in life and never had a chance to build a career and achieve financial freedom. And their family ventures don’t seem to be successful. Some became single moms. Some have got a full house – a child and a husband. And in both cases women had to work.  In fact, in all cases and under any circumstances women are employed. Can you even imagine not working woman??!! Is she lazy or crazy??!! Women cannot possibly imagine that they can have an option of not working. Do not expect help or support from your husband. Relying on someone’s help is humiliating. Remember? Girl learned it very well by now. And it is a status quo today – both parents need to work. I want to be able to wake up and it was just a bad dream, not a reality.</p><p>Success matters and nothing else!</p><p>By the age of 24-35 years, those girls have achieved a lot in business, diplomas, but absolutely unhappy and lonely. They have never felt what it means to be a beloved woman. Nonetheless, they can afford expensive and fashionable clothes, personal driver and their very own apartment they proudly earned themselves.</p><p>The masculine world has its own laws and orders. One of the important laws of the masculine world is the competition for the first place. They often fight simply to experience the joy of the fight. That gives them an influx of strength and testosterone. Man feels excellent by winning this fight, so he can be patronizing those who lost.</p><p>Struggle and competition have a different effect on women. Victory does not bring her happiness. Stress does not allow her to relax and enjoy the victory if she won. She just accumulated testosterone and depleted her oxytocin – hormone responsible for motherhood. And no wonder there are wealthy women out there who have fertility issues.</p><p>If you are to list men’s skills a woman possesses in an effort of becoming successful, you will get list as follows:</p><p>• Get more.</p><p>• Lead.</p><p>• Give orders and clear instructions.</p><p>• Asking for help is humiliation and defeat.</p><p>• Take responsibility.</p><p>• Be an advocate.</p><p>• Intimidate.</p><p>• Ultimatums.</p><p>• Proactive actions.</p><p>• Attack and insult, so they leave you alone.</p><p>• Do not pay much attention to little things in life.</p><p>• Concentrate on the project, forget about everything else.</p><p>• Avoid emotional conversations and clarification of relationships.</p><p>All this describes the behavior of men, which are absolutely natural for them. The reasons men live by those principles are because they have different tasks created for them by the nature, evolution and society. </p><p>For women, compliance with such rules and behaviors became very expensive.</p><h2 id=\"don-t-expect-help-\">Don’t expect help!</h2><p>There is a notion that children need to be brought hard working, self reliant, making smart choices in life. However, that model is only applied to a boy. Girls need to be brought up as princesses. Like Barbies. Being adults those strong successful women are dreaming to become a little child again and your parents would take care of you, take you by the hand, make decisions for you so you would not have to make them… Kids are associated with care free life, but once you become an adult – you must grow up, focus, think, make plans, live in fear, work, survive. No. It is only applicable to boys. Girls always have to stay like kids – naive, trusting and kind. And it is possible! How? There is a tradition that the girl needs to be protected at all time first by her father, then by the husband and later by the son. This absolute truth I figured out by the age of 30 after following this set of rules, always being stressed, scared of the future, single and very unhappy, just trying to create an artificial happiness. I did not know that there are some rules of a womanly life. But again generations ago the world have lost this knowledge. Noone knows. And now we keep telling our children that there is no one to rely on, they need to be strong. We tell it to both boys and girls. It does not matter if that child is a girl – she lives on the masculine side and according to masculine laws it is not acceptable to be weak, give up and ask for help. Help from others is embarrassing.</p><p>So you grew up in the male world, learned and lived by male rules and principles. You forgot you are a woman. Your Life force was sucked out of you by this strenuous life with no break for true happiness. That is because you lived your life that was never yours. It doesn’t feel good, does it? I want to believe that this girl is having the blast and I hope she will never know the rules and principles we learned and followed.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"/content/images/2018/10/aroni-738302_1280.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p><a href='https://ko-fi.com/F1F0MXYU' target='_blank'><img height='36' style='border:0px;height:36px;' src='https://az743702.vo.msecnd.net/cdn/kofi2.png?v=0' border='0' alt='Buy Me a Coffee at ko-fi.com' /></a></p>\n","comment_id":"5bbf1e5ac13f981064c896ed","plaintext":"Journey to your homeland begins here…\nDo you love to travel?

In a\nmodern society, it is important for a woman to achieve success at work, but it\ndoes not contribute to her inner peace, it only increases the level of\ntestosterone in her body. Testosterone is produced due to stressful situations,\nher desire to win, the need to make decisions and make priorities. For men,\ntestosterone is a natural condition. Testosterone is necessary for a man – it is\nthe source of eternal fuel. Testosterone does the magic for male’s body. So the\nlogic is men are the one who supposed to be under stress and pressure, because\nthey come with built-in antidote – testosterone. With that logic if a man is\nfeeling depressed, that means he is not under stress. Being under stress, fight,\ncompetition, argument is only natural for men.\n\nTestosterone acts as antidepressant for men, but not for women. In a state of\ndistress, she starts selflessly serve others instead of concentrating on herself\nand her own needs.\n\nThe skyrocketing level of testosterone in modern women makes them think that the\nroles of mother, caring housewife and loving wife are burdensome, uncool, not\nacceptable and not enough. The predominance of testosterone in the female body\nleads to anxiety and feeling of abandonment.\n\nOur body, unlike the male, accumulating testosterone, loses the ability to rest.\nWomen do not understand that and try to sort things out as soon as possible,\ninstead of relieving stress by restoring the level of oxytocin. They think once\nthey finish all the things they planned, they will finally rest, maybe start\ndating. And they not only do it themselves, but also expect the same from their\nhusbands and children. Instead of being the source of support, her male partner\nturns into an additional burden for her.\n\nWhat is the trade off?\nIt’s tough to relax and start believing in love and the happy life. Believe that\nthe husband will finally start to provide for a family. It’s challenging to\nbelieve that you can be taken care of not because you have earned it, but\nbecause you are kind, full of life and the light. Can you imagine being covered\nwith a warm blanket when you are cold, have a breakfast made for you, and\nsomeone special is telling you tender words?\n\nUntil now, you have done all of this and much more for your loved ones,\nexpecting that they will do the same thing for you someday.\n\nThe score has not been in your favor for many years. Thousands and thousands of\ndeeds you did for loved ones were taken for granted. Thousand and one – and then\nyou would feel better, they will finally notice and appreciate your sacrifice\nfor them…\n\nHowever, this does not happen. Day after day you overcome fatigue, doing more\nand more with each and everyone.\n\nEvery day we have to get to work and compete with men, suffer, survive and\nfight. And guess what? We want love after we become winners. Unknowingly, we\nchoose to struggle for the right to be known as a strong woman. We gave up\nfemale happiness in exchange for that title. Is it worth it? We got involved in\na man’s game – only the winner can be considered successful. For men this is\nenough, but women want something else.\n\nSuccessful woman may find herself in bed with not very successful man who used\nhis strength and body to be the winner. No wonder after a good time with a\nwoman, a man does not feel connected to her, and a woman does.\n\nIn the struggle for the first place, many women become angry, strict, harsh. God\nforbids bursting into tears or showing weakness… Everyone does what they have\nto. No one cries! There is no one out there to listen to your complaints. You\ncan cry when no one is looking. Everyone seems to be ok with their life. I don’t\nsee single moms are complaining about their life. And if you are single strong,\nsuccessful, independent woman – what do you have to complain about? Your life is\ngreat!\n\nWomen’s weakness is perceived as a flaw and something to be ashamed of.\n\nIt is just so difficult to be a woman!\nThe woman’s excellent ability to collect complete information about everything\nand everyone turned out to be endless torment for her. She is always\ndissatisfied with the fact that she feels insufficiently competent, she tortures\nherself with doubts, inventing her personal issues and problems. And the way she\novercomes her doubts – she works hard.\n\nThis does not happen with men, because they use information for solution of a\nspecific problem that is being solved at the moment – without allegory, specific\ntone, emotions and hints. Therefore, many women are surprised to see how a man\nwho is not very knowledgeable and competent achieve rapid success with full\nconfidence in his superiority.\n\nWe respond differently to stress and trouble.\n\nFor men silence is a rest of mind, for a woman – it is a punishment.\n\nThe woman in silence constantly thinks about what has been said, and what else\nneeded to be said and done. Often her thinking is based on negative situations,\ndeveloping a sense of bitterness and defeat.\n\nWe are taught to remain silent and think what we say, but this method is only\nsuitable for men. A woman can think and find the long-awaited answer, only by\ntalking about the problem.\n\nA conversation is necessary for a woman. By talking she relieves stress and\nfinds the right positive decision. However, talkativeness is condemned in the\nsociety of men. They learn how to speak. They know what and how they will say\nit.\n\nA woman, living on the male half of the world, does not even know her\nadvantages, opportunities, rights, privileges, duties as a female.\n\nWe are taught from the very childhood to behave like men, not showing female\nbehavioral stereotype. Various women are not happy that they were born as women.\nThey do not know how to live a female life and how to be happy as a female.\n\nWhen will this end?\nWhy do you think this world is so fierce? No, women have never been told what it\nreally means to be a woman. Are you ready to go back home?\n\nModern society became so atomized that each of these halves considers themselves\nself-sufficient, independent from each other. But these two worlds cannot exist\nwithout each other.\n\nFor several decades, women have been learned to act and think like a man. They\ndeclared – women are equal to men! As a result of new paradigm men began to rule\nthe world and dictate their rules. Both men and women are required to play by\nmale‘s rules. The rules of the feminine half of the world were just forgotten.\nThere was a confusion. Men and women assembled in the male half of the world and\nbegan to fight for the place under the sun.\n\nThe feminine half of the world was left almost uninhabited.\nSeveral generations have changed, and people have forgotten about the loss. They\nbegan to think that the world is very small. In this tiny world, men and women\nstarted feeling lonely and sad for no obvious reason. That happened because the\nknowledge about the soul and true love has been lost on the other half. The male\nhalf of the world is now densely populated, while female half of the world has\nonly a few happy inhabitants.\n\nSince ancient time, a woman was a guardian of the heart and the soul of her\nhusband. Thanks to her his soul could sing. The woman herself was the SOUL of\nthis world and the universe. Women knew a lot back then before the loss…Now,\nbecause of the overload of the male part and the small population of female one\n– the world became unbalanced.\n\nWomen still want love and happiness, but don’t know how awaken the man’s soul.\nSo they apply male methods.\n\nEverything is messed up.\nWhat is the biggest desire of the female heart?\n\nHappiness, harmony of the soul and body and, of course, the long-awaited LOVE.\nAnd to receive every blessing will not require hard work. What will be required\nfrom you instead of hard work?\n\n• A wish\n\n• Patience\n\n• Aspiration\n\n• Thirst for bliss and love\n\nFarewell, male world!\n\nBeing in a male world all your life, you have earned your place there. You\npushed, poured, defended, argued, defeated, competed, conceded. Now you chose to\nleave everything behind and change your life dramatically. Before you left I\nprovide you with an overview of methods and rules society used on you to make\nwho you are today – strong, independent, successful woman.\n\nIn the beginning it was joy, and then… school was created\nYou were in the same class of boys. Your teachers often criticize you in front\nof the whole class. They could even organize a competition between girls and\nboys. So girls learn to compete with boys using their brain early on in life.\n\nThe physiological growth and development of boys and girls are quite different.\nFrom an early age, the boy first has to grow and master his physical body. He\nruns, jumps, climbs, fights, break bones, get stitches.\n\nThis is the first phase of becoming a man. He wishes to be the best, so he must\nbe the best. He often has fights with another boy, he feels his power and place\nin the world. If his opponent is also keen and clever, they can then become best\nfriends. Having mastered and developed his male body, having got experience of\nskirmishes and defending his view of the world, the boy begins to engage his\nbrain. That means that the second period of boys‘ life has begun.\n\nWhat transformation a girl undergoes in school?\nThe girls are different. Very early girls start collecting the information about\nthe world in which she will live and raise her future children. She plays\n“daughter-mother” game, where the mother – Barbie is flawless beauty. Ken is her\ndedicated husband and together they live in a Barbie house. She dresses her\nBarbie in the most gorgeous dresses. Because of the girl’s imagination she is\nBarbie. And her life will be just like Barbie’s life. Everything will be\nprovided for her, she just has to remain beautiful and happy. You don’t see boys\nplaying with Barbie. While girls are playing their game, boys are testing new\nasphalt. Seriously, they want to find out how it tastes like…  By the time of\nhigh school. Girls collected enough information about this world to pass it on\nthe child.They became sexually attractive, because they are ready to have kids.\nBoys are interested in the look of girls. Sometimes it makes it difficult for\nthem to study…Those girls who cannot cope with the hormonal reorganization of\nthe body and competition in school becomes typical “difficult teenagers”.\nNevertheless, teachers will use all sorts of methods of influence, forcing girls\nto study better. Humiliation, insults, shaming in front of the entire class are\ncommon. Calling out parents to complain about their daughter only strengthens\nthe girl‘s self-doubt. The girl closes herself from the world and really starts\nto notice more and more imperfections in her appearance. Here are some life\nprinciples we learned in school:\n\n• Compete, the first is the best.\n\n• Strive to become a winner, fight if necessary.\n\n• Work hard to get the best marks.\n\n• Pursue leading positions (head of the class committee).\n\n• Learn to please teachers and those who make decisions.\n\nSeries of unfortunate events for girls have just began…\nThis set of rules and behaviors of the masculine world was taught to girls. As a\nresult, after finishing school or college, a girl does not have a very good\nopinion about herself and tries to compensate her own idea of her\nunattractiveness by competing with men in knowledge, workload and burning desire\nto reach the peak of career ladder. In fact, she learns to forget about the\ngorgeous looks, fashion, beauty, about everything from Barbie had. The look will\nnot get you anything in life. However, good marks and discipline will. Now it’s\ntime to take care of yourself and just think about your future. You have to find\na job that will help you earn money and buy yourself a place to live. The\npursuit of prestigious and expensive things will begin soon, because they will\ntell everyone about your status and success. Only then you will be in a position\nto declare a victory. You will have a legitimate right to be arrogant and\ncondescending towards the losers, who engaged into family-kids matter too early\nin life and never had a chance to build a career and achieve financial freedom.\nAnd their family ventures don’t seem to be successful. Some became single moms.\nSome have got a full house – a child and a husband. And in both cases women had\nto work.  In fact, in all cases and under any circumstances women are employed.\nCan you even imagine not working woman??!! Is she lazy or crazy??!! Women cannot\npossibly imagine that they can have an option of not working. Do not expect help\nor support from your husband. Relying on someone’s help is humiliating.\nRemember? Girl learned it very well by now. And it is a status quo today – both\nparents need to work. I want to be able to wake up and it was just a bad dream,\nnot a reality.\n\nSuccess matters and nothing else!\n\nBy the age of 24-35 years, those girls have achieved a lot in business,\ndiplomas, but absolutely unhappy and lonely. They have never felt what it means\nto be a beloved woman. Nonetheless, they can afford expensive and fashionable\nclothes, personal driver and their very own apartment they proudly earned\nthemselves.\n\nThe masculine world has its own laws and orders. One of the important laws of\nthe masculine world is the competition for the first place. They often fight\nsimply to experience the joy of the fight. That gives them an influx of strength\nand testosterone. Man feels excellent by winning this fight, so he can be\npatronizing those who lost.\n\nStruggle and competition have a different effect on women. Victory does not\nbring her happiness. Stress does not allow her to relax and enjoy the victory if\nshe won. She just accumulated testosterone and depleted her oxytocin – hormone\nresponsible for motherhood. And no wonder there are wealthy women out there who\nhave fertility issues.\n\nIf you are to list men’s skills a woman possesses in an effort of becoming\nsuccessful, you will get list as follows:\n\n• Get more.\n\n• Lead.\n\n• Give orders and clear instructions.\n\n• Asking for help is humiliation and defeat.\n\n• Take responsibility.\n\n• Be an advocate.\n\n• Intimidate.\n\n• Ultimatums.\n\n• Proactive actions.\n\n• Attack and insult, so they leave you alone.\n\n• Do not pay much attention to little things in life.\n\n• Concentrate on the project, forget about everything else.\n\n• Avoid emotional conversations and clarification of relationships.\n\nAll this describes the behavior of men, which are absolutely natural for them.\nThe reasons men live by those principles are because they have different tasks\ncreated for them by the nature, evolution and society. \n\nFor women, compliance with such rules and behaviors became very expensive.\n\nDon’t expect help!\nThere is a notion that children need to be brought hard working, self reliant,\nmaking smart choices in life. However, that model is only applied to a boy.\nGirls need to be brought up as princesses. Like Barbies. Being adults those\nstrong successful women are dreaming to become a little child again and your\nparents would take care of you, take you by the hand, make decisions for you so\nyou would not have to make them… Kids are associated with care free life, but\nonce you become an adult – you must grow up, focus, think, make plans, live in\nfear, work, survive. No. It is only applicable to boys. Girls always have to\nstay like kids – naive, trusting and kind. And it is possible! How? There is a\ntradition that the girl needs to be protected at all time first by her father,\nthen by the husband and later by the son. This absolute truth I figured out by\nthe age of 30 after following this set of rules, always being stressed, scared\nof the future, single and very unhappy, just trying to create an artificial\nhappiness. I did not know that there are some rules of a womanly life. But again\ngenerations ago the world have lost this knowledge. Noone knows. And now we keep\ntelling our children that there is no one to rely on, they need to be strong. We\ntell it to both boys and girls. It does not matter if that child is a girl – she\nlives on the masculine side and according to masculine laws it is not acceptable\nto be weak, give up and ask for help. Help from others is embarrassing.\n\nSo you grew up in the male world, learned and lived by male rules and\nprinciples. You forgot you are a woman. Your Life force was sucked out of you by\nthis strenuous life with no break for true happiness. That is because you lived\nyour life that was never yours. It doesn’t feel good, does it? I want to believe\nthat this girl is having the blast and I hope she will never know the rules and\nprinciples we learned and followed.\n\n  [https://ko-fi.com/F1F0MXYU]","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/10/woman-1149911_1280-1.jpg","featured":1,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"Why No One Talks How Tough It Is To Be A Woman In A Man's World?","meta_description":"Men and women somehow gathered on the male side of this world and started playing according to male’s rules.\nThis confusion has led to the fact that not only women, but also men cannot find a real place.

Throughout history, their purity and chastity were highly valued. They got married innocent. These traditions were maintained until 1915.

They got married innocent. These traditions were maintained until 1915. Then two world wars destroyed the family as such and broke the balance between roles of men and women.

The\nSanskrit word “stri” means “woman.” Dharma is a polysemantic word meaning the\npath of religion, piety, loyalty, obligation, duty and much more. “Stri dharma”\nis the natural path of a woman. There are two main schools of thoughts about\nwomen in modern society. The western women’s liberation movement and its\nopposition that advocate traditional values. The so-called struggle for women’s\nfreedom greatly influenced everyone, even in India, Iran, Japan and other\nplaces.\n\nTrue liberation starts with leaving work and returning home\nI wish there was a non profit organization in the West called Counsel of Truly\nFree and Happy Women. Its mission would be to set western women free from\nliberation, and empower them to live together according to their nature as\nmothers and wives. For a woman, liberation starts with leaving work and\nreturning home. As soon as she returns home – she becomes free. Work keeps her\nin the realm of outer consciousness and under the influence of propagandist\nmachine, while returning home enables her to live according to her true inner\nbeing. In the West, a woman is a wife at first, and then a mother. But in the\nEast, her maternal duties come first. For generations mother has been teaching\nher daughter about home affairs. Not how to seek for a job.\n\nTraditional values – what is wrong with them?!\nTwo thousand years ago the Indian poet Thiruvalluvar made such an observation:\n“Is it possible for a man to lack something if he has a good wife? And does a\nman have everything if he has a bad wife? “In the East, the woman and her role\nin society are addressed in great respect. In the West, women are valued no more\nthan bread in the grocery store. Their contribution is discounted, undervalued\nand not recognized. In fact, this is for this reason that women seek\nsatisfaction and recognition in other spheres, because Western society has\nforgotten about their unique, vitally important role. Offended by ignorance, she\nseeks other means to obtain recognition, appreciation and love.\n\nIn the East, family ties are very tight. Women in the family are very close.\nThey live together in a commune, surrounded by older and younger women,\nsometimes in the same house. They mutually support each other – older and more\nexperienced women help the younger. Several generations work together to share\nthe joys and difficulties of life. In the West, everything is different. Here,\nwomen usually cannot benefit from close communication with other family members.\nThey made so many movies with a title “How to survive family reunion this\nChristmas”. Naturally, western women feel lonely, especially if they are not\npart of the religious community. Because of the feelings of loneliness, they\nwant to get out into the world to enjoy life a little in a bar or work place.\nThis is an illusion of joy created by the liberation movement. In the East, the\nfemale and male forces are balanced. In the West, male power is dominant.\nWomen’s energy need more opportunities for manifestation, but it doesn’t mean\nthat women need to do what men do. No. It will only confuse these forces even\nmore.\n\nYou can start with establishing the harmony in your own home. By improving the\nmicrocosm, we impact the macrocosm. In the East, a woman is protected. She is\nlike a precious stone cannot be left unattended, always guarded. Women are not\nput on public display, not forced to give up their chastity. A woman in the East\nhas the opportunity to be completely a woman, showing her real quality –\ntenderness, insight, love, kindness. Home and family are the only duties of\neastern women.\n\nCapitalism dictates its own rules.\nIt is interesting that 60 years ago everything was similar in the West.

Oh boy,\neveryone has so high expectations!!! It is still a thing to be in love and be\nexclusive for each other? Or is it?.. What does a couple share, and what are the\ndifferences? Of course, I will be formulating my opinion about modern free of\nethical standards society of non objectified women and irresponsible pleasure\nseeking men. Let’s find out what men and women want  and expect  from\nrelationships…\n\nSo… What does a woman want from a man?\nFirst of all, to be with him and never leave, to love this man, to be the only\nsource of inspiration for him and always feel desired, irreplaceable, beloved.\nIt is the need for attachment, for belonging. Official psychology would describe\nthis need as being neurotic or being obsessed. And I confirm! We, women, are\naddicted to love. And we are crazy about the object of our obsession! If you are\na woman –, it is “normal” to feel this way. It is our nature – relationship with\na man comes first for every woman! It is the very essence, the blessing and the\nsource of happiness for every woman. A woman is a prisoner of love. The state of\nemotional dependence for her is a norm! Of course, the degree of immersion can\nbe different, but if a woman loves a man, she always dissolves in him, adjusts\nand adapts to him. Woman always adapts. Not a man.\n\nAt the same time, a woman wants to be with no regular man but with the best one:\na billionaire, a Nobel Prize winner, celebrity would also do… She wants a man\nshe can be proud of! With whom she would never regret she chose him. With a man\nwho is “steeper” at least in something: stronger, smarter, richer, more\ntalented. However, without respect and admiration for a man, it is difficult for\na woman to love this man and be the inspiration for him at the same time. Man\nalways has to be ahead of her on every position. And that becomes so hard\nnowadays with emancipated women.\n\nIn addition, the woman wants to be protected. And protected in different ways:\nas an adult woman, as (future) mother of his child and as a little girl. “Adult\nwoman” needs to feel that she is the only one who makes him happy. It is\npointless to demand it by shouting. It is necessary to be attractive and\ninspiring for him – and he will make all your wishes come true. “Little Girl”\nwants protection, care and unconditional love, extra attention. She is entitled\nfor that too. Woman uses hysteria as a proven method to be indeed nasty little\ngirl. She has a full right to make a scene, because this is her nature.\nNegativity is a byproduct of women’s life. She cannot digest it or work it out\nwith psychologist, or take a prozac, or go to gum. She has to let it out! Man\nwas given to a woman in order to protect her from all her problems, fears and\nnegativity.\n\nPerhaps, the need to be in a relationship with a man is more critical than\nanything else. Woman’s self realization is to be loved and love a man. That is\nall – woman only seeks two states – to be a wife and a mother. However in many\nwomen in Western society the need for recognition comes first: as well as\nvanity, status, achievements, independence. We get what’s called a “heartless\nbitch” – when a woman competing with other women. Then the man from the subject\nturns into an object, and women can start to hunt on him. That is the mental\nstate of all free women.\n\nWhat men want in the relationships?\nUnlike woman, a man values his autonomy. Why? A man forms his identity\nseparately from a woman, he must become “someone” in the male world, that is\nwhat defines him. So he creates a winning strategy in order to become “someone”\nindeed. In other words, the masculine self-realization is going outward. He\nmeasures himself against the others and participants of the social game. (But\nfor his Mom, he is already the best!). Therefore, a normal man chooses a woman\nwho, first of all, will understand and support his life position and will become\nhis inspiration, not a competition. The biggest ordeal for a man is – who do you\nthink? Those independent feminists women, who are equal, who have the same\nmental model as he does – compete and win, and don’t be weak. That is the answer\nto why we have pleasure seeking, irresponsible men today. Because women have\nsuch an effect on them! Men are married to women who laugh at them and do not\nhave any respect for them. Man stops being responsible when a woman starts\ndisrespecting him. [https://www.xojane.com/issues/feminism-has-made-men-lazy]\n\nA man is not scared of his failure in a relationship. If a woman is unhappy and\nrejects him, this is extremely painful for him. If the need for respect and\nrecognition is not met, the man leaves the relationship, no matter how much the\nwoman is in love with him. Feminist women don’t know how to love men for\neveryone’s benefit. They castrate the man - by placing his importance for a\nfamily after a dog's one.\n[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-end-of-men/308135/] \nHe needs the recognition not only from his woman, but also from society and have\nstatus, his wife, her charm, sexual attractiveness, which is also evident to the\nother men! Nonetheless, if narcissism is strongly pronounced, then you know how\nit looks: a woman turns into expensive “status gig”.\n\nThe need for neurotic attachment is expressed somewhat weaker in men than the\nneed for respect and success. This is the principal difference between men and\nwomen. Men is also afraid of loneliness, they also want love, but a man will not\ntune in or adjust to a woman. Some women manage to kill the ego of their\nhusbands and they become weak men who are incapable to provide for all, where\nhis wife gets this recognition for being a hero – hard working parent with a\nfully functioning husband in the house. Women invoke this curse on themselves\nand their men. A man chooses  a woman, while a woman makes  a man. And she has\nthe power to make him great or miserable.\n\nAttraction of the opposites.\nWhat is common to both sexes in love – is this paradoxical attraction of the\nopposites (potentials)! Men are attracted to purely feminine in women (her\nbeauty, her stories, her hysteria), and women are attracted to purely masculine\nin men (power, money, muscles, intellect). What one does not have attracts the\nother. Delight fuels the excitement… Therefore, there must be a mystery in the\npartner, an incomprehensible differences, if you will… Only then the interest in\nthe partner will not fade away, and the soul of both will sing as they find an\ninfinite goodness in each other.\n\n  [https://ko-fi.com/F1F0MXYU]","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/11/people-2595862_1280.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":"What needs men and women seek to satisfy when they are “in love”?

Allow me to narrate a short story, a Buddhist nun who had a small statue of Buddha, made of solid gold. She would carry it while travelling from monastery to monastery.

You have become attached to your Buddha, even though the entire teaching of Buddha is non-attachment.”Monk carried on: “This serves you right.

We will open at\nleast one door of our prison with this thought.\n\nThen go back to your memory. Try and think of instances when you felt superior\nbecause of some achievements. It could be one thing, very small. Anything. Like\ncoming first in the class in your second year in school, or getting a good\nremark from a teacher for an essay or a math answer. That will break open\nanother door.Now begin counting your blessings. Do not have a functioning\nkidney? Can you see? Can you hear? Can you smell? Are your hands ok and so on.\nWill you sell your eyes at any price? No! Who told you have no money? You are a\nwealthy person who is unaware of your wealth, your blessings, Isn’t it? This\nwill open one more door.Break the last door by thinking of the goals you might\nwant to achieve. Be sure you can do that. Start planning. Think of ways. Talk to\npeople. Be ready for a long struggle but with a firm resolve that you will\nachieve the objectives. This will take you out of the prison of your thinking\nand make you a new person ready to fight. Prepare to be carried out. You are a\nwinner in making! \n\nWe chose Material Over Spiritual.\nWhen talking about love, attachment, jealousy, people think they know exactly\nwhat love is, but they do not. And their misunderstanding about love creates\njealousy. By ‘love’ people mean a guaranteed monopoly, some possessiveness,\nwithout understanding a simple fact of life – the moment you possess a living\nbeing, you kill him. Life cannot be possessed. You cannot get it in your fist.\nIf you want to find it, you must keep your hands open. Sometimes people are so\npossessive that they become attached even to objects. Allow me to narrate a\nshort story, a Buddhist nun who had a small statue of Buddha, made of solid\ngold. She would carry it while travelling from monastery to monastery. Her\nproblem was that every morning she would worship her Buddha and burn incense.\nBut incense cannot be directed, can it? Now this was very distressing. Her own\nbuddha was sitting there, while her incense, her offering had flown away to some\nother Buddha in some other temple.She finally devised a strategy to help ensure\nthat the incense reached her Buddha, and her Buddha alone. She followed out a\ntiny bamboo and she kept it on her incense burner, directing the perfumed smoke\nwith the hollow bamboo towards the nose of her very own Buddha. \n\nNevertheless, very soon there arose another problem. The nose of her Buddha\nturned black with the smoke. She was in a great distress – a gold Buddha, a\nsolid gold Buddha, with a black nose. It simply did not seem right.She inquired\nof older monks: “What should I do now? If I don’t use the bamboo, then the\nincense… nobody knows exactly where it goes. It goes to all kinds of Buddhas\nwhen I’m offering it to me. And now due to this bamboo, his nose has turned\nblack. What should I do? ”An elderly monk laughed and said. “Woman, you are an\nidiot! You don’t understand the simple fact that all Buddhas are the same – they\nare simply statues of the same person. You have become attached to your Buddha,\neven though the entire teaching of Buddha is non-attachment.”Monk carried on:\n“This serves you right. The buddha has shown you that attachment makes you\ndirty. So beware! Go to a goldsmith so he can clean and polish your Buddha. But\nfrom now on, just think of THE Buddha. Any Buddha, whichever Buddha gets the\nincense… perhaps he deserves it! And you should be happy that it has reached\nsome statue, because all those statues represent the same person.”\n\n- Unhappy people consider themselves to be victims of life and remain stuck in\nthe\" appearance of what has come to me,\".\n\n- Happy people are mindful of the world's problems, but they also balance their\nconcern with seeing what is right and good.\n\n- Unhappy people tend to close their eyes to anything good in the world in fear\nthat they may be distracted from what is wrong.\n\n- Happy people take steps every day to achieve their goals, but ultimately,\nthere is very little control over what life is throwing at us. \n\nHappiness is just as much a physical experience as a mental state, and our\nobsession with achieving happiness as a society, regardless of situations, leads\nto the suppression of real feelings that are also important such as sadness,\nfear, anger. Happiness takes courage, courage to make the decision to change\nthings that took you to the unfortunate road and not the happy one. Happy, here,\nis not much of an emotional response to the stimuli of the moment, but\nfascination of a person with life in general, a cheerful approach to the\nactivities of the day and a jovial attitude towards the future. Life is tough -\nno doubt about it - but you can't be responsible for the happiness of someone\nelse but your own. Or can you?...\n\nLearning new things definitely improve your self-esteem, but you also become\nburdened with the knowledge and develop an urge to act upon your ideas. And\nusually smart people who understand too much - they are the least happy. Above\nall, awareness will help you to realize that the never-ending quest for money,\nfame or power will never make you happy. It is the path to the hell. I hope most\npeople wake up and stop being preoccupied with things that have no meaning.\n\nYour happiness is based exclusively on your decision to be happy. As someone\nsaid, we are unhappy when we perceive a distance between our standards for the\nworld (and our place within it) and the realities we encounter. Knowing that\nyour daily actions can change your life and your future is what keeps people\ngoing. But the guys who said those things wasn't bright as my favourite Bertrand\nRussell. And I cannot omit the greatest mind of the 20th century and his famous \n\"Conquest of Happiness\".\n[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.222834/page/n7]  \n\nEverything is external - expectations, pride, fear, failure. But they become\ninsignificant in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.\n\"America alone in the thrall of hypercapitalism believes that only seeing people\nas assets is clarity, not the very definition of blindness.\" \"the dark portrait\nthat Haque paints of modern day - American youth and the success.\" \"Envy was\nincreasing because we don't just know about our neighbors' fortune, through\nmovies, the press and education we know the lifestyles of the rich and famous.\"\n\"Today, those same dreamers find it quite unsettling to watch as the tools that\nwere designed to bring people together are used by people to magnify divisions\nand undermine social solidarity.\" \"If there is to be less envy, means must be\nfound for remedying this state of affairs, and if no such means are found our\ncivilization is in danger of going down to destruction in an orgy of hatred.\"\n\"Russell uses the phrase \"sense of sin\" to talk about the feeling of doing\nsomething wrong, not living up to a moral code.\" \"To see in imagination the\nsociety that is to be created, where individuals grow freely, and where hate and\ngreed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them.\" \"To be genuinely\nindifferent to (public opinion) is both a strength and a source of happiness. \nAnd he wrote it in the last senture. Have things changed and his hopes for\nhumanity are coming to be true? In my opinion things are getting worse. Just\nlook at Forbes and look again, and think. I took some screenshots of American\nelite. \n\nYes. Great. They made it. Will you be able to make it? Will I?... But first -\npseudo elite. \nAnd what exactly have they done? They were trying to be rich! They wanted money\nin every possible way. They love money more than anything else. They did not\ninnovate, make a scientific breakthrough or left intellectual legacy. The only\nmotivation was money. \n\n> \nReal elite.\nLet's look at the other one who made the Forbes cut. Is his motivation only\nmoney? Is money motivation for those people at all?... Like Jeff Bezos said:\n\nIf you found your passion as the way to make a living, you hit the home run; if\nyou have a career - it is also good; but when you have a job - that means you\nare not the happiest.  \n\n\n\n  [https://ko-fi.com/F1F0MXYU]","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/10/photo-1463362603537-22059ee1ac77.jpeg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"You Kept Asking \"Why Am I So Unhappy\" - Here Is Your Answer","meta_description":"Imagine a person in a prison.

I hope it will wake up one day.</p><p><a href='https://ko-fi.com/F1F0MXYU' target='_blank'><img height='36' style='border:0px;height:36px;' src='https://az743702.vo.msecnd.net/cdn/kofi2.png?v=0' border='0' alt='Buy Me a Coffee at ko-fi.com' /></a></p>\n","comment_id":"5bcaca1b130e881132da075b","plaintext":"The CDC conducted the study 2007 – 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey\n[https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/pdf/trendsreport.pdf]  and here are\na few highlights.\n\n“The Talk”\nTeens’ experiences with sex are changing for better over that decade: ”Fewer are\ninitiating sex, fewer are currently sexually active, they’re having fewer\npartners, and they’re using more effective hormonal birth control methods.” The\nonly one bad news for that year was recent decline in condom use.\n\nIn 2007, 61.5 percent of teens said they’d used a condom during their last\nsexual encounter. By the year of 2017, that rate had dropped to 53.8 percent. It\nmight be related to a decrease over time in requirements for the school to cover\nHIV and [sexually transmitted diseases] in their health education programs.\n\nAccording to the report, young people aged 15-24 account for half of the roughly\n20 million new STDs reported each year.\n\nMore than one in 10 young women (11.3 percent) reported being forced to have\nsex.“Sex education is about life skills,” said Elizabeth Nash, senior state\nissues manager at the Guttmacher Institute. “There are so many aspects you take\nwith you for the rest of your life, but you only get it once or twice in\nschool.\"\n\nHowever, public schools are the best opportunity for adolescents to access\nformal information. Of course, many young students pick up sexual health\ninformation from sources other than school — parents, peers, medical\nprofessionals, social media and pop culture.\n\nComprehensive sex ed goes beyond the biophysical aspects\n[https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/06/16/620278545/what-teens-really-say-about-sex-drugs-and-sadness]\n. “It’s about focusing on the emotional, psychosocial and economic impacts of\nwhat happens when youth and adolescents engage in sexual intercourse and other\nsexual practices,”“It’s hard to get legislators behind comprehensive sex ed. In\nrecent years, states have begun to mandate sex ed to include information about\nlife skills for family communication, avoiding coercion and making healthy\ndecisions. \n\n“There are rewards and consequences to our behavior at every age across the\nlifespan,” she said. “We can’t always assume that an adolescent will wait to\nbecome an adult before making adult decisions. In areas where sex ed isn’t\nrequired, states can assume that parents will educate their children at home,\nbut studies show that adolescents are increasingly more likely to seek\ninformation from social media and online communities, which can be more\ninclusive of gender and sexual minorities, but not consistently reliable for\nmedical accuracy. Granger said assigning responsibility for “The Talk” is part\nof the problem that leaves teens uninformed.\n\nDid you know - sexually active guys are called studs and girls are called\ntramps, some young women who choose to have sex may drink in order to minimise\nsocial consequences by blaming alcohol. The girls are well aware that if they\n“hook up with someone when totally sober they are more likely to be slut-shamed\nor to have people be terrible to them about their sexuality.” Adults can look\nfor opportunities to rectify this sexist and dangerous imbalance. For example,\nif we hear teenagers talking about girls who have drunken sex, or peers who use\nterms such as whore or slut, we should ask, “Why is it OK only for guys to hook\nup?” and “Why do girls alone have to worry they’ll get bad press if they have\nsober sex?” \n\nSociety fails young generation over and over.\nIn today’s world he can get you pregnant and disappear. Sometimes with the\nreasoning – we both were young and in love, but i was not ready to become a\nfather. And that is because young women are neither being watched out by their\nparents nor being educated on the subject. Young women in schools are not being\ntaught that there is a man out there and you most likely will end up with one of\nthem. And it is a duty of schools and society to teach not about contraception\nmethods and fear mongering with STDs . This sets her for false belief that she\nis empowered from now on and she can now go and explore her sexuality (aka “how\nto up bring the whore”). It also gives men an opportunity to fuck as many women\nas they want. Finally. Schools and parents basically saying a word of wisdom to\nyoung generation – here is a condom and you are now prepared for life.\n\nThat is why you end up in the situation where you wanted sex and he was up to it\nbut he never wanted a child or getting his own place. You wanted a child so here\nyou go and you are welcome. “There are so many horny women out there who need my\nhelp in satisfying their sexual desire!” – he told her. And that is the spirit\ntoday! Man thinks his job is to provide for himself, take good care of himself,\ndate women and give them the best sex of their life.\n\nDating is just a formality that is not even needed in most cases because women\nsee how hot he is, what a great body he has – so they want to skip the formality\nand get down to business. Because she is horny and he is hot as hell! He knows\none thing about himself – he makes every woman wet. And that is the absolute\ntruth based on his own experience. But very unfortunate one.\n\nAll women have those high moral standards at birth to be loyal, to give love, to\nreceive protection, to give birth to a child, to take care of the family – those\nvalues were built in us by the evolution. So evolution preserved the survival of\nmankind in women. A baby – even male gender would not survive without women\ntaking care of him full time. We are the ones who want kids. Men want to fuck,\nfight, have a locker room talk bragging about how many women they screwed.\n\nFirst, let’s begin by clearing up these misconceptions about these services that\nPlanned Parenthood offers. For one, Planned Parenthood is not only for women.\nIt’s for men too. And it’s not all abortions. It’s really generally not\nabortions. Planned Parenthood offers good, affordable healthcare to 5 million\npatients a year… services like screening and treatment for STDs, contraception\nand family planning, chest tests, and cervical cancer screenings. Now that we’ve\npassed that up, back to Planned Parenthood. Many of us have tried out their\nservices at some point in our lives, but even if you haven’t , you get a mother,\ngirl, baby, friend, or neighbour who has. As women, it’s our duty to stand one\nanother and ensure that the establishment exists in for those millions who do\nrely on it.\n\nThe matter is, pro-choice or pro-life, abortions want to be minimized, but in\nthe correct direction. Minimizing abortions is not about keeping women from\ngetting abortions. It’s about keeping the need for making an abortion. According\nto the World Health Organization, abortion rates are similar in states where\nthis process is legal and in states where it is not, due to unavailability of\nadvanced contraceptives in countries where abortion is illegal. What we want is\nbetter healthcare laws and facilities, good and economic preventive methods for\nthe masses, right sex education in schools, accessibility of family planning\nalternatives to the common folk, and also to understand the importance of making\nresponsible sex, because abortion is not only about the choice you make now,\nit’s also about the choices you made.\n\nMental Health\nPerhaps the biggest red flags were in the section devoted to mental\nhealth.Roughly a third of teens surveyed said they’d experienced persistent\nfeelings of sadness or hopelessness.“I think that’s really significant and\ncertainly not what we want to see if we’re trying to send our kids into\nadulthood in the most healthy way.”The news is even worse for students who\nidentify as lesbian, gay or bisexual. Nearly two-thirds reported persistent\nfeelings of sadness or hopelessness.\n\nIn fact, in every category, LGB teens were at higher risk than their\nheterosexual classmates. They were twice as likely to report being bullied in\nschool or electronically, three times as likely to seriously consider suicide\nand four times as likely to attempt suicide.“It’s shocking and alarming and\ntells us that things are terribly wrong,” says Ellen Kahn, director of the\nChildren, Youth & Families program at the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. “We\nseriously need to address this.\"\n\nLiberal moral standards.\nIn America, not everyone considers the fundamental moral truths of the\n”self-evident” Modern” liberal, which rejects absolute moral standards\n[https://americanhumanist.org/what-is-humanism/human-basis-laws-ethics/], has\nabandoned the proper order of the fundamental rights of man. The moral confusion\nof liberty over the holiness of human life and the vital importance of the\ntraditional family has changed American law and society. Films, television,\nmusic and the Internet bomb young people with cultural messages of sexual\nrevolution and self-absorbed materialism, which corrupts their good moral\ncharacter and kind human nature. \n\nEssentially, morality becomes universal when you define everything else that is\ndifferent in terms of morality that removes all the small but significant\nboundaries in definitions. Morality is the root of many important things about\nlife, simply because morality is actions and behaviours that lead to good health\nand well-being of individuals and communities. Morality is therefore the basis\nof law, survival, religion, government, fraternity, fraternity, education,\nscience, marriage and anything that concerns life. However, the law is not\nnecessarily the same as morality, but there are many moral rules that are not\ngoverned by human legal authorities. \n\nWhen asked about what was wrong with moral values, many americans reacted by\ntalking about the lack of consideration of others, the lack of compassion,\npersonal responsibility, respect and tolerance of greed, selfishness, dishonesty\n- in addition to things such as the change in family structure, the lack of\nreligion, the lack of morality (a certain sense of thought). One can argue that\nthe Founding Fathers did not always agree with their interpretation of such\nreligion, but the vast majority of them drew their moral and ethical guidelines\nfrom the Ten Commandments and the teachings and examples of Jesus. Politics is\nsimply a reflection of the moral and ethical principles of society at large.\nThere is something in human nature that works at a deeper level than the mere\ntheological faith, and it is that it serves as the real reason for moral\nbehaviour. I hope it will wake up one day.\n\n  [https://ko-fi.com/F1F0MXYU]","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/11/pablo--69-.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"Teaching Morality and Ethics Would Save America's Failing Education System","meta_description":"Teens’ experiences with sex are changing for better: ”Fewer are initiating sex, they’re having fewer partners, and they’re using more effective hormonal birth control methods.” Bad news for that year was recent decline in condom use.

If a man is thoughts and ideas, a woman is their embodiment. If a pure and faithful wife believes in her man. But if she is jaded, unhappy and unsatisfied with him – his is simply doomed to succeed. Creator kills his own creation instead of making it a masterpiece. A woman with a healthy woman’s energy has the gift to put into his head any ideas and visions that he will later turn into live. That’s why, the thought of a woman is equated with the action of a man. But only, of course, if she is devoted to her man, sincerely believes in him, knows how to serve selflessly. Women’s energy is able to save or kill. It is good for a husband to be under protection of an energetically strong woman. And even at a distance, this defense is very powerful. #becomehappy #findingpurpose #findingpeace #findinghappiness #findingyourself #selflovefirst❤ #selfloveisthebestlove😘 #selflovejourney🌷 #harmonyisthesourceofbeauty #beyourownbeloved #youaretheone #yourlifeisyourart #youaretheprincess #youaretheuniverse #youarethereason #yourwayofthinking #yourchoiceyourlife #yourwayoflife #yourvalue #innerlight #blessallpeople #femalepower #divineenergy #pureabsolutebeauty #acceptyourgreatness #divinelight #divinepurpose #divinepowers #datingyourself</a></p> <p style=\\\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\\\">A post shared by <a href=\\\"https://www.instagram.com/chiefdatingofficer/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\\\" style=\\\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> Date like noone else</a> (@chiefdatingofficer) on <time style=\\\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\\\" datetime=\\\"2018-10-08T16:01:02+00:00\\\">Oct 8, 2018 at 9:01am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\\\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\\\"></script>\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"FINALLY!!! IT IS HERE!!! That means I care about you guys a lot!\\n\\nI want to change your life one by one. One life after another. One broken heart after another. I have a cure for your wounds, girls. I have it!! I committed to heal your scars of every woman out there, because I feel your suffering. \\nAnd I am on the mission to change your set of mind - kinda pass my knowledge into you ultimately transforming and rebooting your mentality. (not painful - actually lots of fun and no surgery involved).\\nFull disclosure: I am always a bad cop. And I use shock therapy.\\n\\nThe goal is not give you a fish and feed you with meaningless quotes from some database and give you affirmations and let you go with blessing. I will teach you how to fish. Meaning you will be able to think rationally about who is good Enough and who hasn't gotten there. \\n\\nThe main outcome of this program is my philosophy becomes yours organically. That is the reason why I am not preaching to convert - I expect on the program already converted (meaning you kinda get it and kinda like it). Speaking of which - I am not there to use dogma as an explanation of how the life works. It is the job of religion. I am coming from a different species which were stuck in that matrix (aka simulation - That is another story - I will tell you all about it if you'd like me to). I like to explain things colorfully, not just accept them because they are coming from the Bible. I take a bible or any other scripture and use reasoning and scientific knowledge and explain the legitimacy of the dogmatic claim with my personal magic (working term - you will see what I mean when I do). I connect the dots - I make sense.\\n\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"Here is where the fun starts. I will be an investigator, a nasty one. I will need a background story of each of you. And don't you worry - I have KGB memory - I don't need any database. So FIRST MONTH of me of asking you difficult questions will be FREE.\\n\\n\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"\\n# Rules:\\n1. Yes. It is that long of a program. Some girl asked - could I just skip dating and go straight to serious relationships? No. It is part and the rule. You don't like it - you are not a good fit for the program! \\n2. No sex, hookups in closets, living together, test drive or free wife trial before the marriage!\\n3. Noone can take your breath away within 3 months even 6 months! A man starts from \\\"a boring nerd\\\" and can grow to become Good Enough after a month of dating. You are a picky Woman.   \\n4. Dating at least 3 lucky guys at a time. I will have lectures on where you can meet a nobel man and why it is important to date 3 at a time. \\n5. You will have to do your reading of articles and some other material I will be sending you. And I will also ask you to do some tasks that you will need to perforn and tell me next time I see you how it went.\\n\\n# Phases:\\n1. We will be working on our worth, self esteem which society lowered since we went to a kindergarden. We learned to live in the man's world and play by their rules - we become equal. Then why is this girl is crying her eyes out because he dumped her, and the guy is bragging about dumping her? We should all explore our sexuality - but why does it hurt so bad... \\n2. We will have each other in order to lift each other up. With the power of technology will have technology you can reach me any time and quigly ask super important question of emergency. If you feel like \\\"I saw him and it was the love from the firts side\\\" - this is definetly an emergency. Not be fooled - call me. It is safer. \\n3. Please write some memorable events that happenned between our sessions. It can be inspiration or an abscure guy... So we can clear him. Like a scanner. \\n4. Dating, emotional harmony, relationships of souls, engagement and the wedding.THAT IS THE PLAN.\\n5. I will be giving you non traditional exercises that should become your daily routine. No. Those are not to repeating the generic quotes in front of the mirror for 2 hors. Everything I produce original and from the heart and again - I will act as magic. \\n\\n# Format of our work:  \\nGood news: I want to be honest and make it like a journey, where people from all over the world coming together and trying to solve the same problem. And they become friends. \\n\\nBad news: Unfortunately world runs on money. It is a long program and your commitment and dedication. It is a lot of work for me and even bigger commitment for me, because i have to do my homework, read, wright and amuse you. \\n\\n- First month is free which consists of first intake face to face where I learn about your background and we get to know each other. \\n- And after the first seccion you will get homework (yes - already). \\n- We will meet twice a month. 2 hours of practical advice, those rules of life that I learned from scriptures and from being an evolutionary biologist. Life hack course. If you need to meet more time with me - we can arrange it. \\n\\n\\n# Why Am I doing that?\\n\\nDon't think that the small fee for a membership that will change your life is a loss, it is an investment into your carefree protected life with beloved husband. I think, career coaches for women, people who tell you that you are enough and you can build an empire is not the right pathway for a woman to choose. Moreover it sends you to the path of great unhappiness. (sorry career coaches - but you only make men happy). I offer you to fulfill all desires of your heart - motherhood, empire, a husband who would take care of your, your kids and your elderly parents and you have to have only one qualification - to be a woman. And willingness to become the biggest inspiration for your husband. \\n\\nI started this not because I love money more than people. But the money always comes up. I value relationship more than money. ANd I would like to see you as divine creatures, not how many dollars I can make from each of you by selling high ticket programs. I want thriving community of women finally reclaiming their place in the world. And if everyone will be on its place and do what ever brings joy - that is called happiness. \\n\\n# How much: \\n###600$ for the whole program.   \\n- Differences between men and women on biological level and spiritual. Illusions of women regarding love. How to make your man the man of honor by being the inspiration for him. Warning signs this man is destroying you. 14 Questions you need ask before the wedding day. Stages of building relationships. 6 Steps To Increase Female Self Esteem. 30 habits you need to leave behind moving forward to a happy marriage. 10 myths about sex. How to protect your man from being irresponsible. 10 Qualities of a good Man. 9 women's silly mistakes that can become lethal for the family. \\n\\n# Here is my promise: \\n- First month is free. if you don't like me or what I talk about or any of those rules. You can drop out after first month no problem.\\n- if you cannot see me on regular basis - like you went on spiritual retreat, practice belly dance, get 2 massages per day to increase your feminine energy, or take a long walk to himallaii. Let me know and we will pick up where we have left. \\n- if you want to stop at any point and never hear from me again. I call it a split. You will get refund for the months you haven't used. You get no more charges. Life goes on.\\n- and if by the end of the year there is no improvement in your self esteem, quality and quantity of your male friends, if noone proposed to you by the end of the year. Or you haven't gone to the stage of relationship of the souls. That means I did not deliver on the promise - I would be happy to give you all money back. \\n- I am not dreaming to sell high ticket coaching programs. I seriously feel the pain of women who haven't been educated on who they are. That will make the world as a better place. And not hight ticket coaching.  \\n- Just let's make the most out of it. Be kind to each other. And enjoy the ride. I am going to entertain you. It will be fun.  \"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"<!-- Calendly inline widget begin -->\\n<div class=\\\"calendly-inline-widget\\\" data-url=\\\"https://calendly.com/irinabulygina/120\\\" style=\\\"min-width:320px;height:580px;\\\"></div>\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\" src=\\\"https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.js\\\"></script>\\n<!-- Calendly inline widget end -->\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[10,1],[10,2],[10,3],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","html":"<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BorZXsaArVl/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

If a man is thoughts and ideas, a woman is their embodiment. If a pure and faithful wife believes in her man. But if she is jaded, unhappy and unsatisfied with him – his is simply doomed to succeed. Creator kills his own creation instead of making it a masterpiece. A woman with a healthy woman’s energy has the gift to put into his head any ideas and visions that he will later turn into live. That’s why, the thought of a woman is equated with the action of a man. But only, of course, if she is devoted to her man, sincerely believes in him, knows how to serve selflessly. Women’s energy is able to save or kill. It is good for a husband to be under protection of an energetically strong woman. And even at a distance, this defense is very powerful. #becomehappy #findingpurpose #findingpeace #findinghappiness #findingyourself #selflovefirst❤ #selfloveisthebestlove😘 #selflovejourney🌷 #harmonyisthesourceofbeauty #beyourownbeloved #youaretheone #yourlifeisyourart #youaretheprincess #youaretheuniverse #youarethereason #yourwayofthinking #yourchoiceyourlife #yourwayoflife #yourvalue #innerlight #blessallpeople #femalepower #divineenergy #pureabsolutebeauty #acceptyourgreatness #divinelight #divinepurpose #divinepowers #datingyourself</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chiefdatingofficer/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_medium=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Date like noone else</a> (@chiefdatingofficer) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2018-10-08T16:01:02+00:00\">Oct 8, 2018 at 9:01am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script><p>FINALLY!!! IT IS HERE!!! That means I care about you guys a lot!</p>\n<p>I want to change your life one by one. One life after another. One broken heart after another. I have a cure for your wounds, girls. I have it!! I committed to heal your scars of every woman out there, because I feel your suffering.<br>\nAnd I am on the mission to change your set of mind - kinda pass my knowledge into you ultimately transforming and rebooting your mentality.

And I use shock therapy.</p>\n<p>The goal is not give you a fish and feed you with meaningless quotes from some database and give you affirmations and let you go with blessing. I will teach you how to fish. Meaning you will be able to think rationally about who is good Enough and who hasn't gotten there.</p>\n<p>The main outcome of this program is my philosophy becomes yours organically. That is the reason why I am not preaching to convert - I expect on the program already converted (meaning you kinda get it and kinda like it). Speaking of which - I am not there to use dogma as an explanation of how the life works. It is the job of religion. I am coming from a different species which were stuck in that matrix (aka simulation - That is another story - I will tell you all about it if you'd like me to). I like to explain things colorfully, not just accept them because they are coming from the Bible. I take a bible or any other scripture and use reasoning and scientific knowledge and explain the legitimacy of the dogmatic claim with my personal magic (working term - you will see what I mean when I do). I connect the dots - I make sense.</p>\n<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Here is where the fun starts. I will be an investigator, a nasty one. I will need a background story of each of you. And don't you worry - I have KGB memory - I don't need any database. So FIRST MONTH of me of asking you difficult questions will be FREE.</p>\n<h1 id=\"rules\">Rules:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Yes. It is that long of a program. Some girl asked - could I just skip dating and go straight to serious relationships? No. It is part and the rule. You don't like it - you are not a good fit for the program!</li>\n<li>No sex, hookups in closets, living together, test drive or free wife trial before the marriage!</li>\n<li>Noone can take your breath away within 3 months even 6 months! A man starts from &quot;a boring nerd&quot; and can grow to become Good Enough after a month of dating. You are a picky Woman.</li>\n<li>Dating at least 3 lucky guys at a time. I will have lectures on where you can meet a nobel man and why it is important to date 3 at a time.</li>\n<li>You will have to do your reading of articles and some other material I will be sending you. And I will also ask you to do some tasks that you will need to perforn and tell me next time I see you how it went.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"phases\">Phases:</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>We will be working on our worth, self esteem which society lowered since we went to a kindergarden. We learned to live in the man's world and play by their rules - we become equal. Then why is this girl is crying her eyes out because he dumped her, and the guy is bragging about dumping her? We should all explore our sexuality - but why does it hurt so bad...</li>\n<li>We will have each other in order to lift each other up. With the power of technology will have technology you can reach me any time and quigly ask super important question of emergency. If you feel like &quot;I saw him and it was the love from the firts side&quot; - this is definetly an emergency. Not be fooled - call me. It is safer.</li>\n<li>Please write some memorable events that happenned between our sessions. It can be inspiration or an abscure guy... So we can clear him. Like a scanner.</li>\n<li>Dating, emotional harmony, relationships of souls, engagement and the wedding.THAT IS THE PLAN.</li>\n<li>I will be giving you non traditional exercises that should become your daily routine. No. Those are not to repeating the generic quotes in front of the mirror for 2 hors. Everything I produce original and from the heart and again - I will act as magic.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"formatofourwork\">Format of our work:</h1>\n<p>Good news: I want to be honest and make it like a journey, where people from all over the world coming together and trying to solve the same problem. And they become friends.</p>\n<p>Bad news: Unfortunately world runs on money. It is a long program and your commitment and dedication. It is a lot of work for me and even bigger commitment for me, because i have to do my homework, read, wright and amuse you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First month is free which consists of first intake face to face where I learn about your background and we get to know each other.</li>\n<li>And after the first seccion you will get homework (yes - already).</li>\n<li>We will meet twice a month. 2 hours of practical advice, those rules of life that I learned from scriptures and from being an evolutionary biologist. Life hack course. If you need to meet more time with me - we can arrange it.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"whyamidoingthat\">Why Am I doing that?</h1>\n<p>Don't think that the small fee for a membership that will change your life is a loss, it is an investment into your carefree protected life with beloved husband. I think, career coaches for women, people who tell you that you are enough and you can build an empire is not the right pathway for a woman to choose. Moreover it sends you to the path of great unhappiness. (sorry career coaches - but you only make men happy). I offer you to fulfill all desires of your heart - motherhood, empire, a husband who would take care of your, your kids and your elderly parents and you have to have only one qualification - to be a woman. And willingness to become the biggest inspiration for your husband.</p>\n<p>I started this not because I love money more than people. But the money always comes up. I value relationship more than money. ANd I would like to see you as divine creatures, not how many dollars I can make from each of you by selling high ticket programs. I want thriving community of women finally reclaiming their place in the world. And if everyone will be on its place and do what ever brings joy - that is called happiness.</p>\n<h1 id=\"howmuch\">How much:</h1>\n<h3 id=\"600forthewholeprogram\">600$ for the whole program.</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Differences between men and women on biological level and spiritual. Illusions of women regarding love. How to make your man the man of honor by being the inspiration for him. Warning signs this man is destroying you. 14 Questions you need ask before the wedding day. Stages of building relationships. 6 Steps To Increase Female Self Esteem. 30 habits you need to leave behind moving forward to a happy marriage. 10 myths about sex. How to protect your man from being irresponsible. 10 Qualities of a good Man. 9 women's silly mistakes that can become lethal for the family.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"hereismypromise\">Here is my promise:</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>First month is free. if you don't like me or what I talk about or any of those rules. You can drop out after first month no problem.</li>\n<li>if you cannot see me on regular basis - like you went on spiritual retreat, practice belly dance, get 2 massages per day to increase your feminine energy, or take a long walk to himallaii. Let me know and we will pick up where we have left.</li>\n<li>if you want to stop at any point and never hear from me again. I call it a split. You will get refund for the months you haven't used. You get no more charges. Life goes on.</li>\n<li>and if by the end of the year there is no improvement in your self esteem, quality and quantity of your male friends, if noone proposed to you by the end of the year. Or you haven't gone to the stage of relationship of the souls. That means I did not deliver on the promise - I would be happy to give you all money back.</li>\n<li>I am not dreaming to sell high ticket coaching programs. I seriously feel the pain of women who haven't been educated on who they are. That will make the world as a better place. And not hight ticket coaching.</li>\n<li>Just let's make the most out of it. Be kind to each other. And enjoy the ride. I am going to entertain you.

Please write some memorable events that happenned between our sessions. It\n    can be inspiration or an abscure guy... So we can clear him. Like a scanner.\n 4. Dating, emotional harmony, relationships of souls, engagement and the\n    wedding.THAT IS THE PLAN.\n 5. I will be giving you non traditional exercises that should become your daily\n    routine. No. Those are not to repeating the generic quotes in front of the\n    mirror for 2 hors. Everything I produce original and from the heart and\n    again - I will act as magic.\n\nFormat of our work:\nGood news: I want to be honest and make it like a journey, where people from all\nover the world coming together and trying to solve the same problem. And they\nbecome friends.\n\nBad news: Unfortunately world runs on money. It is a long program and your\ncommitment and dedication. It is a lot of work for me and even bigger commitment\nfor me, because i have to do my homework, read, wright and amuse you.\n\n * First month is free which consists of first intake face to face where I learn\n   about your background and we get to know each other.\n * And after the first seccion you will get homework (yes - already).\n * We will meet twice a month. 2 hours of practical advice, those rules of life\n   that I learned from scriptures and from being an evolutionary biologist. Life\n   hack course. If you need to meet more time with me - we can arrange it.\n\nWhy Am I doing that?\nDon't think that the small fee for a membership that will change your life is a\nloss, it is an investment into your carefree protected life with beloved\nhusband. I think, career coaches for women, people who tell you that you are\nenough and you can build an empire is not the right pathway for a woman to\nchoose. Moreover it sends you to the path of great unhappiness. (sorry career\ncoaches - but you only make men happy). I offer you to fulfill all desires of\nyour heart - motherhood, empire, a husband who would take care of your, your\nkids and your elderly parents and you have to have only one qualification - to\nbe a woman. And willingness to become the biggest inspiration for your husband.\n\nI started this not because I love money more than people. But the money always\ncomes up. I value relationship more than money. ANd I would like to see you as\ndivine creatures, not how many dollars I can make from each of you by selling\nhigh ticket programs. I want thriving community of women finally reclaiming\ntheir place in the world. And if everyone will be on its place and do what ever\nbrings joy - that is called happiness.\n\nHow much:\n600$ for the whole program.\n * Differences between men and women on biological level and spiritual.\n   Illusions of women regarding love. How to make your man the man of honor by\n   being the inspiration for him. Warning signs this man is destroying you. 14\n   Questions you need ask before the wedding day. Stages of building\n   relationships. 6 Steps To Increase Female Self Esteem. 30 habits you need to\n   leave behind moving forward to a happy marriage. 10 myths about sex. How to\n   protect your man from being irresponsible. 10 Qualities of a good Man. 9\n   women's silly mistakes that can become lethal for the family.\n\nHere is my promise:\n * First month is free. if you don't like me or what I talk about or any of\n   those rules. You can drop out after first month no problem.\n * if you cannot see me on regular basis - like you went on spiritual retreat,\n   practice belly dance, get 2 massages per day to increase your feminine\n   energy, or take a long walk to himallaii. Let me know and we will pick up\n   where we have left.\n * if you want to stop at any point and never hear from me again. I call it a\n   split. You will get refund for the months you haven't used. You get no more\n   charges. Life goes on.\n * and if by the end of the year there is no improvement in your self esteem,\n   quality and quantity of your male friends, if noone proposed to you by the\n   end of the year. Or you haven't gone to the stage of relationship of the\n   souls. That means I did not deliver on the promise - I would be happy to give\n   you all money back.\n * I am not dreaming to sell high ticket coaching programs. I seriously feel the\n   pain of women who haven't been educated on who they are. That will make the\n   world as a better place. And not hight ticket coaching.\n * Just let's make the most out of it. Be kind to each other. And enjoy the\n   ride. I am going to entertain you. It will be fun.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":1,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":"Make a guy marry you in 18 months.

In order to find true female happiness, it is very important to learn to live, feel life right now.</p><h2 id=\"superpower-of-a-real-woman-\"><strong>Superpower of a real woman.</strong></h2><p>By nature man has strength. Their body, their muscles are arranged in such a way as to perform physical work, to exert physical efforts. Men are more enduring than women.

And, of course, man is very susceptible to her influence.</p><p>So what effect does a woman have on her husband and children knowing that? Entering a serious relationship with a man, and especially starting to live with him, a woman gets some power over him. This power is manifested in the fact that a woman can influence his mood. If a woman feels joyful, satisfied, inspired then her mood is transmitted to her husband. Even if he comes from work in a bad mood, under her influence his mood gradually improves, he calms down, and problems go on the background. The opposite is also true.

By nature, we are given a powerful force. And it is not contained in our muscles. Our strength is our energy.

A lot has been written about the sources of women’s energy. These include caring for your body (a variety of beauty treatments, massage), wearing feminine clothing, water procedures, sleep from 22:00 to 02:00 hours, developing creativity). But the main source is communication with God (Universe, Higher Powers as you wish to call it).</p><p>There are three types of prayers (types of communication with the Higher Powers). The first kind of prayer is a prayer-request. In such a prayer, we turn to God for help – asking to solve our problems, ease the suffering. The second type of prayer is prayer-gratitude. Here we thank the universe for what we have in our lives. The third type of prayer is prayer-initiation or prayer-tradition. In such a prayer, we sincerely tell God that we accept our life as it is, even if it is full of difficulties, accept the divine will, devote our lives to God. If communication with God on ongoing basis is new to you, start with the smallest and simplest – speak sincerely what you think, and ask the universe that she owes you:). Then express your gratitude for what you already have. Again, for this purpose you can have a notebook where every day before going to bed, write at least 10 thanks to God (remember all the good things that happened over the day, do not forget to thank for your loved ones, for housing, food, etc.). Develop spiritually – read relevant literature, engage in spiritual practices, strive for a higher level, commit yourself to divine will and service.</p><p>Another divine service your can do for yourself - go dancing. Get a membership to gym not to do heavy lifting or crossfit - go and take Zumba. Dancing is like the balm for my wounded soul. Or just find the aerobics from 80s or 90s, turn the music up and loud and pump it up. </p><p>Communication with God gives the best filling effect in the absence of devoted man. But that is the challenge – your goal to become happy with yourself and love yourself. Man will not give you love or make you happy. He is your magnifying glass. If you are unhappy – you are going to be more unhappy with him and make him miserable. If you are already happy and here comes the Prince saying: “Madame, I would like to make you the happiest person”. Your responce should be: “Then you have to try hard, because I am already the happiest.” </p><p>In conclusion, in order to be ready admitting a worthy man in your life – you need to be already hally and already love yourself. So prepare yourself with spiritual practices. The mood improves, you feel an emotional rise, a sense of security appears, you feel yourself “in flux”. Life seems and it becomes easier. Dear girls!

The\nexternal component – everything that relates to our body – tidiness, neatness,\nand her today’s image (makeup, hairstyle, dress). The internal component is our\nfeminine qualities and virtues – delicacy her light all around. This amazing\npower – female energy – makes a woman truly happy, peaceful, grateful,\nbeautiful. It is what , tenderness, complaisance, emotional psyche, warmth,\ncompassion, the ability to cooperate, etc. The energy component is an internal\nfemale power that makes a woman shine from within and spread her light around.\nThat energy makes a woman a real Woman.\n\nThe container of female energy is the womb. Nurtured by healthy female energy\ndoes not induce painful periods. It was created by nature not cause anease and\npain, it was given to her so a woman could bear children. That is also where\nwomen’s energy is accumulated. Some women (all women) have a very painful\nperiods nowadays. That is because energy is not accumulated there or accumulated\nenergy is not a female kind… (belongs to a female entrepreneur, for example). It\nprovides the woman with good health and well-being, it is necessary for the\nbearing of healthy children.\n\nWomen’s energy is needed for realization of all aspects of her destiny – to\n“nurture” her creative projects, to help a man in the realization of his talents\nand dreams, to give to the world new citizens and to bring abundance in\neveryone’s life. \n\nThe power of female energy is immense. \nBeing a woman means being filled with light, be inspired by yourself, to have\nyour own inner world where you are well all alone, without other people. Women’s\nenergy is true trust in God. When you are convinced that at any given time,\nevery second of your life you are protected and blessed. When you know that\neverything what happens is right and for a reason. You are not punished. Nobody\nmakes fun of you. The Loving Power of the Creator teaches you, helps you find\nthe right direction. Women’s energy is serenity, it is still and peaceful. There\nis no anxiety, her actions, her gait, her speech are purposefully rhythmical. It\nresembles a wonderful flower.\n\nFemale energy is the ability to give your man positive emotions – when next to\nyou, his anxieties is on the background, he feels that you are happy with him\nand everyone is happy. True female energy can be a source of happiness for a\nman. He enjoys your appearance, your inner state and becomes happy with you. The\nman is inspired by being blessed by your healthy female energy. From this energy\ngrows his strength and success. It takes two components: woman’s energy and\nfaith in her man – once he becomes motivated by the idea that his family is the\nsource of inspiration, his beloved woman will live in prosperity, happiness and\nhis faithfulness. It becomes in his best interest to continue this bliss and\nmake sure it never ends. \n\nWomen’s power is energy. If a man is thoughts and ideas, a woman is their\nembodiment. If a pure and faithful wife believes in her man. But if she is\njaded, unhappy and unsatisfied with him – his is simply doomed to succeed.\nCreator kills his own creation instead of making it a masterpiece. A woman with\na healthy woman’s energy has the gift to put into his head any ideas and visions\nthat he will later turn into live. That’s why, the thought of a woman is equated\nwith the action of a man. But only, of course, if she is devoted to her man,\nsincerely believes in him, knows how to serve selflessly. Women’s energy is able\nto save or kill. It is good for a husband to be under protection of an\nenergetically strong woman. And even at a distance, this defense is very\npowerful.\n\nWhere we do we recharge?\nDespite the fact that we all have come from different backgrounds and cultures,\nwe all have one prerequisite to generate the energy. We need to be happy in\norder to generate this vital energy for ourselves and everyone around us. \n\nThe basic need of women is the need for security, physical protection, peace of\nmind (emotional, physical and monetary). This need must be met first. Otherwise\nthe woman becomes anxious. And anxious woman is not a source for inspiration. \n\nMan can give her physical protection. In some Asian and Muslim countries – where\ntraditions are still preserved – women still do not walk alone on the streets.\nThey are not allowed to walk by themselves only with guardians – husbands,\nfathers, brothers. Even the looks of strangers to women are not tolerated there.\nYou understand that in our society women are not protected in any way. \n\nAt the same time man can give her emotional protection. It would be nice to have\na man who would block the flow of our torments and chaotic thoughts – so we\nwould not destroy ourselves and others. He would also provide us with the\nnecessary pair of shoes “good to wear one time”.\n\nWhat makes a woman happy?\nTo realize that you are important.  Self-esteem affects a woman’s sense of\nhappiness in the most serious way. For the most part, we are as happy as we live\nin harmony with ourselves. And the first step in finding this harmony is to\nrealize that I am important. It is important who you are, what you feel, what\nyou want, what you think about, what you need. Listening and careful treatment\nof yourself is a solid foundation of women’s happiness.\n\nMindset of Living here and now.  The practice of awareness is an integral part\nof women’s happiness. In fact, happiness is always here and now – not in the\npast and not in the future, but in the present moment. Remember, as in the song\n“There is only a moment between the past and the future, it is called Life.”\nGold words. Living consciously means being aware of your feelings at a specific\nmoment, to realize your desires and needs, to feel your body, to let yourself be\nhappy, to realize what is happening around, to realize your actions. To see the\nbeauty of Life. Everyday is beautiful and sacred, every moment is a gift from\nGod. In order to find true female happiness, it is very important to learn to\nlive, feel life right now.\n\nSuperpower of a real woman.\nBy nature man has strength. Their body, their muscles are arranged in such a way\nas to perform physical work, to exert physical efforts. Men are more enduring\nthan women. In addition, men have a stronger will, resistance to external\nfactors. These qualities are given to men by nature. Birth claim of a man (given\nhim by evolution) – fulfill his destiny by influencing and changing the world. \n\nWomen are much less stress-resistant and possesses much less physical strength.\nHowever, a woman has a much greater psychological (psychic or psychotic i would\ncall it) power than a man. When a woman experiences any emotions, her heart\nemits very powerful energy waves that can affect the environment.
